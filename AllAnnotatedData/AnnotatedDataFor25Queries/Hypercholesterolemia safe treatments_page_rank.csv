One of the limiting factors to the achievement of goals in such patients is      therapeutic non-adherence. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an      intervention designed to improve control of hypercholesterolaemic patients, consisting of a      combined strategy that would include the delivery of printed information,      treatment-compliance check cards and the dispatch of text messages as complementary measures      in support of the intervention at the general practitioner's practice.      Methods/Design A randomised, parallel-group clinical trial will be conducted at the family      medicine outpatient facilities of eight health centres in three of Spain's Autonomous      Regions, covering a total of 358 subjects aged 18 years or over with diagnosis of      hypercholesterolaemia. Patients in the intervention group will be supplied with printed      material with information on the disease and its management, mobile-telephone text messages      with guideline summaries, reminders of forthcoming appointments and/or arrangements for      making new appointments in the event of non-attendance, and self-report cards to check      compliance with recommendations. Both groups -intervention and control- will receive routine      recommendations from their physicians in accordance with current European clinical practice      guidelines for hypercholesterolaemia and cardiovascular risk management. As regards the      measurements to be made, the main variable is the proportion of subjects who attain the low      density lipoprotein cholesterol levels set as a target across a follow-up period of 24      months. The secondary variables are as follows: adherence to recommendations on lifestyle and      adherence to drug treatment; variation in lipid profiles and cardiovascular risk levels;      appearance of cardiovascular events; physical activity; food consumption; smoking habit;      anthropometric measures; blood pressure; health problems; use of hypolipidaemic agents;      socio-demographic data; beliefs and expectations about preventive recommendations; and degree      of satisfaction with the combined strategy.      Discussion Should this intervention prove effective, a recommendation could be issued on the      application of this combined strategy to subjects with hypercholesterolaemia.

Evidence suggests that certain      vegetables, including beetroot and the green leafy vegetables, possess high inorganic nitrate      concentrations. The investigators recent evidence suggests that inorganic nitrate provides a      source of gas called nitric oxide in the body that exerts a number of beneficial effects upon      the heart and blood vessels . The investigators have previously shown that beetroot juice      ingestion improves blood vessel (vascular endothelial) and platelet function in healthy      volunteers. Studies by the investigators show that these effects are due to conversion of      nitrate to nitrite by symbiotic (helpful) bacteria (located on the tongue) and subsequent      conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide in blood vessels. The investigators now wish to explore      whether dietary nitrate, via its beneficial effects on platelets and blood vessels, might      improve indices of atherosclerotic disease progression in high risk individuals      (hypercholesterolemics). Recruits will have high cholesterol and no known atherosclerosis and      will not yet be on any anti-cholesterol medications. Volunteers will consume a daily dose of      beetroot juice or placebo nitrate-free juice for six weeks. Vascular function will be      assessed using non-invasive techniques at the beginning and at the end of the study using      ultrasound measurement of flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery in the arm      and pulse wave analysis (PWA) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) to measure arterial compliance.
