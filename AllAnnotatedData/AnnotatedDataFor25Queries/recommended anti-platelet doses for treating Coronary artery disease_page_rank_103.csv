Exclusion Criteria:          -  age < 18 years old          -  pregnancy women          -  taking antioxidant vitamins supplements,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of Taiwan. American Heart Association (AHA)      indicated that CVD patients with Statin therapy would decrease the recurrence of CVD. The      goal for lipid lowering in CVD patients was set at the level of low-density lipoprotein      cholesterol (LDL-C) below 100 mg/dL. Coenzyme Q10 is recognized as a lipid soluble      antioxidant, Statin treatment might affect the level of coenzyme Q10. Therefore, the purposes      of this study are going to investigate the relation of coenzyme Q10 with other antioxidant      vitamins (Vitamin A and E), the markers of lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymes      activities, and the inflammatory markers in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients during      Statin therapy. The study is going to design a placebo-controlled study. The investigators      will recruit coronary artery disease (CAD) patients who are identified by cardiac      catheterization as having at least 50% stenosis of one major coronary artery, and healthy      subjects. CAD subjects are randomly assign to placebo and coenzyme Q10 supplements (150      mg/bid = 300 mg/d) groups. Intervention is going to administration for three months. Fasting      blood will be obtained in each month and determine the concentration of antioxidant vitamins,      lipid peroxidation markers, antioxidant enzymes activities after intervention. Meanwhile, the      investigators will measure the level of inflammatory markers in all subjects of this study.      Hopefully, the results of this study could provide information of coenzyme Q10      supplementation for clinical dietitian in advising CAD patients who are under Statin therapy.",,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C1956346;C0056077;C0021368;C0042890;C0087111;C0038435;C0360714;C0233492;C1550655,C1140111,C0599724;C0010054;C0010054;C0007222;C0007430;C0205042;C0242297;C1533734;C0086045;C0056077;C0056077;C0056077;C0056077;C0184661;C0184661;C0056077;C0004083;C0003402;C0003402;C0003402;C0003402;C0003402;C1458156;C0087111;C0042839;C0042890;C1261287;C0042890;C0087111;C0087111;C0018787;C0032042;C0015663;C0087111;C0360714;C0360714;C0001721;C0360714;C1552839;C0360714;C0018787;C0947630;C0947630;C0005767;C1561542;C0947630;C0947630;C0018017;C0050451;C0036849;C1550472;C0442797;C1820370;C0233492;C1555587;C3242430;C0201950;C0005516;C0005516;C0005516;C0005516;C1550043;C0442743;C0442743;C1561542;C0523744;C0523744;C0523744;C0523744;C0392347;C3272565;C1947943;C4082977,C0205042;C0012634,C0018795;C0205042;C0003402;C0032961;C1261287;C0042890;C0087111;C0360714;C1550043;C1947943,C1140111,20130301,,,Completed,24192015,23,23.0,0.009636510043678,0.011922240484334998,CAD patients is identified by cardiac catheterization as having at least 50% stenosis of        one major coronary artery and under statin therapy.,age < 18 years old;;;;;;;;;;pregnancy women;;;;;;;;;;taking antioxidant vitamins supplements

Agonists of Glucagon like peptide - 1 receptors (GLP-1R) used in      the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This category includes exenatide and      liraglutide. These drugs lower glucose levels by inhibiting the secretion of glucagon,      promoting the release of insulin in response to hyperglycemia, slowing gastric emptying, and      augmenting satiety.

It has been shown      that ticagrelor increases adenosine concentration, by interfering with its red blood cells'      uptake and by inducing the release of ATP which is then converted to adenosine. Recent      studies in healthy volunteers and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have shown that      ticagrelor increases the coronary blood flow in response to intravenous adenosine      administration. Ticagrelor administration, in comparison with other P2Y12 inhibitors, may      influence the endothelial function, as assessed by the Peripheral Arterial Tonometry method      (EndoPAT 2000 system (Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel), which is a method for evaluating      endothelial dysfunction and has been found to positively correlate with flow mediated      dilatation (FMD).

Measurement           will be repeated at Day 15 and then treatment crossover will be performed for the next           15 days (without an intervening washout period). At Day 30 patients will be subjected           again to peripheral arterial tonometry assessment.

The aim of      the current study is to evaluate the effects of a psychotherapy intervention on symptoms of      depression in patients with CAD. Therefore, depressed patients diagnosed with CAD will be      randomised into a controlled intervention trial, comparing a stepwise psychotherapy      intervention with usual cardiological care. The manualized psychotherapy intervention starts      with three individual sessions offered on a weekly basis. Afterwards, symptoms of depression      will be re-evaluated and, in case of persisting symptoms, patients receive an additional 25      sessions of psychodynamic group psychotherapy over a total period of one year. The      psychodynamic approach was chosen in order to specifically take into account personality      traits such as negative affectivity and social inhibition, the components of the Type D      personality, which may explain why recent cognitive behavioural psychotherapy (CBT) trials      produced only small effects in depressed CAD patients. The investigators expect that the      intervention will reduce depressive symptoms as well as the prevalence of depressive      disorders. It will also improve both behaviourally and physiologically mediated      cardiovascular risk indicators, promote better quality of life, and reduce healthcare costs.      Subgroup analyses will be performed in order to identify gender-specific treatment effects,      effects on immunological stress reactivity, and genetic predictors of treatment success.",Coronary artery disease;depression;psychotherapy;randomized controlled trial;,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C1956346;C0033968;C0184661;C0344315;C1550655,C1956346;C0033968;C0184661;C2911690,C0010054;C0086132;C0086132;C0033971;C0086132;C0518214;C0035648;C0518214;C3887460;C0033968;C0033968;C0033968;C0871174;C0871174;C0033968;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0086388;C0003944;C0003944;C0011570;C0021467;C0086388;C0033325;C0344315;C0011900;C0344315;C0012634;C0087111;C0087111;C0205160;C1552740;C0025344;C0038435;C0947630;C1561543;C1552651;C0677505;C1457887;C1457887;C0184511;C1518681;C1518681;C1518681;C1518681;C2911690;C0220825;C0233697;C0233697;C3858576;C1552850;C0018792;C1522411;C1522411;C0220825;C0127400;C0009244,C0012634;C0003842,C1290886;C0010054;C0085532;C0349217;C3483981;C0004936;C0018801;C0438696;C0205082;C0205082;C0205082;C0205082;C1546725;C1546725;C0012634;C1550655;C0009797;C1561542,C0205042;C2911690;C0018792,20130401,,,Completed,30717711;29602324;29332628;29078170;27187851;21911098,19,3.1666666666666696,0.009370589301869,0.011001863936277,Patients with coronary artery disease;;;;;;;;;;German speaking men and women;;;;;;;;;;Recent coronary angiogram (<= 3 months old);;;;;;;;;;Depression score (HADS-D) >= 8;;;;;;;;;;Written informed consent,Severe heart failure;;;;;;;;;;Other acutely life- threatening conditions;;;;;;;;;;Severe chronic inflammatory disease;;;;;;;;;;Current suicidal tendency;;;;;;;;;;Severe depressive episode;;;;;;;;;;Other severe mental illness.

Each      patient will undergo an angiogram and CT scan per standard of care. The randomization      strategy in this study is not between patients but between two teams of doctors, the      so-called ""Heart Teams"", will be randomized: in the first round, team 1 assesses the      angiogram, and team 2 assesses the CT scan. Then they make a decision about which treatment      would be the best to treat complex coronary artery disease.

NCT01954303,0,HsTnT in Stable Coronary Artery Disease,Elevated High-sensitivity Cardiac Troponin T Levels in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease,Coronary Artery Disease;Myocardial Ischemia;Coronary Disease;,Inclusion Criteria:          -  Patients of outpatient clinic presenting 12 months after introduction of the hs-TnT             test in june 2009        Exclusion Criteria:,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality      worldwide. Life threatening manifestations such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and      sudden cardiac death are the most important causes of death in many countries. Cardiac      troponin is a biomarker with a high specificity for cardiac necrosis and is recommended for      diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction by the Universal definition of myocardial      infarction. Since a new generation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays has become      commercially available a few years ago, myocardial infarction can be detected earlier and      even small AMIs, that were classified as unstable angina pectoris (UAP) with the less      sensitive assays, are detectable now. On the other side, more patients with acute or chronic      myocardial damage not due to AMI are identified now. Thereby, the reason for elevated      troponin levels should be sought actively, because high troponin levels were associated with      adverse outcome - independent of the underlying pathomechanism. The reasons for troponin      elevations in patients with stable CAD are not clear yet. Associations with extensive      atherosclerosis, carotid lesions and complex coronary plaques in coronary CT scans were      reported. Therefore, patients with elevated troponin levels represent a risk population and      might profit from intensified secondary prevention. In this context, ticagrelor might be part      of a prevention strategy as currently tested in the PEGASUS trial.      We plan to conduct a single-centre pilot study in a cohort with clinically stable patients of      our outpatient clinic, because data regarding prevalence, causes and prognosis of elevated      troponin values in unselected cohorts is sparse. Therefore, all patients (n=910) that      presented to our outpatient clinic 12 months after introduction of the high-sensitivity      troponin T assay (june 2009) and were free of complaints or presented with UAP are being      enrolled. All patients are characterized by demographic, laboratory and clinical      characteristics (including medication) and all available imaging data (exercise-ecg,      echocardiography, stress-echocardiography, computed tomography, cardiac MRI and coronary      angiography) in order to compare baseline characteristics of troponin positive and troponin      negative patients. In addition, the Framingham- and PROCAM-Score representing established      calculators of long-term risk prediction are calculated.      Prognostic endpoints are defined as severe cardiovascular events and progress of the      initially diagnosed disease. Those endpoints are associated with the initial hs-cTnT value      and serial changes.",,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C1956346;C1547311,C1956346;C1141947;C0018787;C1547311;C4321237;C1550655;C0237677;C2946261,C0155626;C0155626;C0002965;C1956346;C0027051;C1320716;C0085298;C0679699;C0679716;C0040405;C1096316;C0013516;C0013516;C0007465;C0004153;C0004083;C1290940;C0412692;C0002978;C1704788;C0021308;C1999375;C0277786;C0013227;C0220901;C0220880;C0005516;C0011900;C1552870;C0033325;C0011900;C0442726;C0018787;C0018787;C0040405;C0700287;C4684790;C0018787;C1446409;C0205160;C0018787;C0018787;C0741968;C0221198;C0542559;C0079595;C0012634;C3827339;C0010957;C0392366;C0087136;C0038435;C0205082;C0031082;C0947630;C1510438;C4050231;C3245479;C3245479;C1578513;C3166866;C0439775;C4699604;C0452240;C0683325;C0376495;C0237677;C0237677;C0680536;C0011164;C3827727;C0011389;C4684637;C1550043;C4067746;C1141947;C0022885;C0022396;C4084912;C0020517;C1141947;C0856882;C1141947;C1141947;C1141947;C0856882;C1141947;C0856882;C1141947;C1141947;C1141947;C1510438;C1510438;C1706074;C1706074;C0018792;C1522411;C1441792;C0150312;C0150312;C0150312;C1334928;C0728774;C0939261;C0029166;C1328899,C0205042;C0012634,C0392366;C4699604;C0376495;C1550655,C1140111,20150401,,,Completed,30872042;29713483,1,0.5,0.014462611124996,0.010522485757517,Patients of outpatient clinic presenting 12 months after introduction of the hs-TnT             test in june 2009,

Changes in lifestyle,      particularly in nutrition and physical activity may significantly reduce a severe coronary      atherosclerosis within one year without the use of medication. Several dietary studies have      shown that not only the progress of coronary artery disease can be slowed down, but it may      also increase significantly the survival of these patients.      Up until now there is little known about therapeutic effects by complementary medicine.

The focal and independent nature of atherosclerosis cannot be due solely to the      presence of systemic risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, cigarette      smoking, and hypertension. Local factors that create a unique local environment are a major      determinant of the behavior of atherosclerosis in a susceptible individual.      The vascular endothelium is in a unique and pivotal position to respond to the extremely      dynamic forces acting on the vessel wall due to the complex 3-D geometry of the artery.      Mechanical forces in general, and fluid shear stress (endothelial shear stress [ESS]) in      particular, elicit a large number of humoral, metabolic and structural responses in      endothelial cells.      Regions of disturbed flow, with low and oscillatory ESS (< 1.0 Pa), are intensely      pro-atherogenic, pro-inflammatory, and pro-thrombotic, and correlate well with the      localization of atherosclerotic lesions. These sites demonstrate intense accumulation of      lipids, inflammatory cells, and matrix degrading enzymes which promote the formation of      high-risk thin-cap fibroatheroma.      In contrast, physiologic laminar flow (1.0-2.5 Pa) is generally vasoprotective. However, as      the obstruction progresses and further limits blood flow through a narrowed lumen, flow      velocity and ESS may increase excessively (> 2.5 Pa) at the neck, and decrease abnormally at      the outlet, increasing the likelihood of platelet activation and thrombus formation.      Identification of an early atherosclerotic plaque likely to progress and acquire      characteristics leading to likelihood of rupture and, consequently, to precipitate an acute      coronary event or rapid luminal obstruction, would permit more definitive pharmacologic or      perhaps mechanical intervention prior to the occurrence of a cardiac event. The potential      clinical value of identifying and ""eradicating"" plaques destined to become vulnerable before      they actually become vulnerable is enormous.      The purpose of the PREDICTION Trial is to identify high-risk coronary lesions at an early      time point in their evolution, to follow the natural history of these lesions over a 6-10      month period, and to confirm that these high-risk lesions are likely to rupture and cause an      acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or develop rapid progression of a flow-limiting obstruction.      The hypothesis is that local segments in the coronary arteries with low ESS and excessive      expansive remodeling will be the sites where atherosclerotic plaque develops, progresses, and      becomes high-risk, leading to a new cardiac event. This study is being conducted in Japan as      patients are clinically evaluated with followup coronary angiography and IVUS in a routine      manner at 6-10 months following their initial percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for an      ACS.      This is a natural history and a clinical outcomes study in patients who initially present      with an ACS. The natural history portion of the study is designed to describe the temporal      progression of atherosclerosis in segments of coronary arteries with low ESS and expansive      remodeling using intracoronary vascular profiling techniques utilizing intravascular      ultrasound (IVUS) and coronary angiography. The clinical outcomes portion of the study is      designed to evaluate the efficacy of coronary vascular profiling to predict segments of      coronary arteries that will become areas of rapid plaque growth or rupture leading to      recurrent major clinical coronary events.      Five hundred (500) patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI for a culprit lesion      are to be enrolled in the study to undergo coronary vascular profiling at the time of the      index catheterization procedure. Up to 374 consecutive patients with at least one low ESS      subsegment are to have follow-up coronary angiography and IVUS at 6-10 months to allow for at      least 300 patients with analyzable intracoronary vascular profiling data for assessment of      lesion natural history. All patients are to have a one-year clinical follow-up to assess for      new cardiac events, followed by two additional years of extended clinical followup.",,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C1956346;C0242656;C0038435;C0700329;C0005847,C1956346;C0242656;C3272565;C0038435;C0700329;C0005847,C0007430;C0948089;C0948089;C2936350;C2936350;C0085532;C0085532;C0085532;C0011849;C0205042;C0205042;C0205042;C0442893;C0004153;C0004153;C0004153;C0004153;C0020473;C0020792;C0741923;C0741923;C0741923;C0035648;C0020538;C0184661;C0184661;C0028778;C1290940;C1290940;C0028778;C0028778;C0242656;C0028778;C0242656;C0232338;C0041618;C0031809;C0018787;C0392148;C0005847;C0087086;C0018787;C0018787;C0018787;C0005847;C0018787;C0005847;C0018787;C4684790;C0018787;C0005847;C0005847;C0221198;C3203359;C0699493;C0221198;C0262512;C0221198;C0750484;C0221198;C3203359;C0262512;C0150312;C0262512;C3203359;C0262512;C0005847;C0003842;C0038435;C0038435;C0523744;C0332148;C0025344;C0332148;C0011389;C0018270;C0221198;C0221198;C0175735;C0175735;C1561542;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0918012;C0027530;C3245479;C1561543;C1550472;C1550472;C1578513;C1550472;C1550472;C1578513;C3849973;C3849973;C2948499;C1704632;C0677505;C0442797;C0935456;C3245488;C0564182;C4055506;C4693090;C2827758;C1882443;C0920995;C0011389;C1561528;C1561528;C0442743;C0022396;C0205161;C4085555;C2707259;C0220825;C0231519;C0449900;C3858576;C1561542;C1561542;C4331837;C1254223;C0221106;C0018563;C3272565;C1522577;C3272565;C3272565;C0220825;C3272565;C3272565;C3272565;C1522577;C0939261;C2363670;C0029166;C0031843,C0205042;C0039082;C0018787,C0002965;C1956346;C0018824;C0013230;C0009924;C2986535;C3245491;C3245491;C1882086;C0018801;C0006663;C1148554;C0035078;C0520886;C0002962;C4281788;C0220825;C0162340;C0439775;C0018787;C0443343;C0018787;C0442711;C0549206;C0549206;C0549206;C0012634;C0012634;C0947630;C0005847;C0005847;C0038257;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C1316572;C1114365;C4699604;C1444657;C1555587;C0680536;C1444783;C4684637;C3272565;C0562357;C4284141;C3899561;C3899561;C3272565;C3272565;C4698437,C1140111,20121201,,,Unknown status,27491487;22723305,62,31.0,0.00787497103001,0.010251584746579,"Age at least 18 years old;;;;;;;;;;Presentation with an ACS (unstable angina pectoris, non-ST elevation MI, or             ST-elevation MI);;;;;;;;;;Coronary artery disease with at least one coronary segment requiring percutaneous             stent deployment using usual clinical indications;;;;;;;;;;At least 1 vessel suitable for IVUS not planned for PCI.;;;;;;;;;;Have the ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written informed             consent","Heart failure, defined as NYHA Class III or IV;;;;;;;;;;Unstable clinical status (ongoing anginal pain or hemodynamic or electrical             instability);;;;;;;;;;Left main disease or three vessel disease;;;;;;;;;;In the opinion of the investigator, significant coronary calcification precluding             protocol evaluations;;;;;;;;;;Investigator determination of renal failure of sufficient severity such that             additional contrast material is contraindicated;;;;;;;;;;Clinically significant valvular heart disease;;;;;;;;;;Investigator opinion of life expectancy < 12 months;;;;;;;;;;Subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or device study that has             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current             study endpoints.

This increases risk of      cerebrovascular/cardiovascular event.      LVH is asymptomatic and managed by the use of medication to control blood pressure, however      LVH may be seen in normotensive patients where factors such as obesity and insulin resistance      are present.      Insulin resistance is a condition where although the body produces insulin it is unable to      utilize it effectively. Metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes, can reduce insulin      resistance and cause weight loss, it may therefore improve LVH. This study will investigate      the ability of metformin to reduce LVH in patients with heart disease, this may be a novel      way forward in the risk reduction of cerebrovascular/cardiovascular events. Participants will      be identified throughout NHS Tayside, those eligible will be randomly allocated to either      metformin or a dummy medication (placebo) and will receive one year of treatment. At the      beginning of the study, the thickness of the heart muscle will be measured by ultrasound scan      and cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cMRI). We will also perform non-invasive tests to      measure blood vessel function. These tests will be repeated after one year. At the end of the      study, we will investigate the difference between placebo treatment and metformin treatment.

L-carnitine (LC) and coenzyme      Q10 is recognized as lipid soluble antioxidants. The purposes of this study are going to      investigate the relation of LC and coenzyme Q10 with the markers of lipid peroxidation,      antioxidant enzymes activities, and the inflammatory markers in coronary artery disease (CAD)      patients. The study is designed as a three-year study. The first year is an observation      study. We will recruit CAD patients who are identified by cardiac catheterization as having      at least 50% stenosis of one major coronary artery, and age-gender matched healthy subjects.      The concentrations of LC, coenzyme Q10, lipid peroxidation markers (TBARS and ox-LDL),      antioxidant enzymes activities (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and      superoxide dismutase), and inflammatory markers are going to analysis. The second year is a      single-blind, single dose intervention study. CAD subjects are recruit form the first year      and randomly assigned to placebo, coenzyme Q10-150 (150 mg/d), coenzyme Q10-300 (300 mg/d),      LC-1000 (1000 mg/d) or LC-2000 (2000 mg/d) groups. Intervention is going to administration      for three months. Fasting blood will be obtained in each month and determine the      concentration of LC, coenzyme Q10, lipid peroxidation markers, antioxidant enzymes      activities, and inflammatory markers after intervention.

Despite treatment with aspirin a large number of patients suffer a myocardial      infarction. This has given rise to the phenomenon ""aspirin low-responsiveness"". Laboratory      aspirin low-responsiveness can be defined as the failure of aspirin to inhibit platelet      production of thromboxane A2 or inhibit thromboxane-dependent platelet aggregation. Whether a      low platelet response to aspirin results in an increased risk of future thrombotic events is      of great clinical significance, but is still unknown.      The investigators hypothesize that patients with a reduced response to aspirin, determined by      platelet aggregation using the apparatus Verify Now Aspirin and Multiplate, have a higher      risk of thrombosis.      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a higher incidence of cardiovascular      events is found in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) having a reduced biochemical      response to aspirin compared with CAD patients having a normal biochemical response to      aspirin.

More potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitors,      such as ticagrelor, have been developed which are associated with less response variability      than clopidogrel and better clinical outcomes. Ticagrelor use has increased significantly      because of its more expanded Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications compared with      prasugrel. However, despite the evidence for sustained efficacy and safety, many physicians      limit treatment duration with ticagrelor to the early phases following an ACS mostly due to      cost issues and concerns about increased bleeding. Therefore, it is very common in clinical      practice to switch patients while on maintenance dosing (MD) with ticagrelor to treatment      with clopidogrel.

In recent      studies a new innovative MRI-technique that can detect changes in oxygen supply of the heart      was able to show that the administration of oxygen or fast breathing can decrease the blood      supply of the arteries supplying the heart muscle with oxygen. Thus, the administration of      oxygen may paradoxically impair the oxygen supply of the heart muscle. In this study the      investigators want to investigate, whether the administration of exogenous oxygen via a mask      alone and in combination with fast breathing leads to a decrease in oxygen supply in regions      with already impaired blood supply by a narrowing of a coronary artery of the heart.",Coronary Angiography;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Oxygen;Hyperoxia;Carbon Dioxide;Apnea;Hyperventilation;,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C1956346;C0035203;C0018787;C1550655,C0024485;C1956346;C1533734;C3887460;C0031809;C0035203;C0030054;C1550655;C0020517;C1455871,C0205042;C1533734;C1533734;C1533734;C0429622;C0429622;C0429622;C0429622;C0678861;C0150158;C0678861;C0004048;C0004048;C0003842;C0947630;C0030054;C0442726;C0030054;C0030054;C0030054;C0030054;C0018787;C0018787;C0018787;C0005767;C0018787;C0018787;C0947630;C0439044;C0018787;C1299581;C0024861;C1578513;C3539181;C0033085;C0442797;C0442797;C1550655;C0184511;C1522411,C0205042;C0012634,C0242231;C0010055;C0027051;C0010054;C0024115;C1301624;C3887460;C3887460;C0008909;C1536078;C0184661;C0184661;C0024115;C0024115;C0002978;C0456984;C1947907;C0013227;C0810633;C0015392;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C4551656;C0543467;C0032961;C0087111;C0429964;C0018787;C1261287;C0021102;C0006644;C0150312;C0543467;C0543467;C3812897;C0006675;C0018787;C0005847;C1301584;C0441633;C0175722;C1547229;C0441633;C0441633;C0441633;C1114365;C1114365;C1561538;C1561538;C0012582;C0086960;C0700845;C1550655;C0424530;C0009797;C0009797;C1947907;C4684637;C1518681;C3541955;C0591863;C1300072;C1561542;C4331837;C0381385;C0018787;C0034770,C0243032;C0018787,20171102,,,Completed,29730991,1,1.0,0.010868087778049,0.008379377223574,"Patients with known relevant coronary artery stenosis (defined by previous coronary             angiography, QCA: reduction in lumen-diameter of the vessel >50%) with a scheduled             intervention or operation to treat this stenosis (staged PCI or coronary artery bypass             surgery);;;;;;;;;;CMR feasible prior to intervention or surgery;;;;;;;;;;Age ΓëÍ18 years;;;;;;;;;;Written informed consent;;;;;;;;;;For healthy participants: Absence of cardiovascular and lung disease, and absence of             medication with cardiovascular effects;;;;;;;;;;Absence of exclusion criteria","General Contraindication against MRI-Scans: (claustrophobia, ferromagnetic implants,             clips, pacemakers, shrapnels, ophthalmic metal deposits);;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy or inconclusive test result;;;;;;;;;;Age <18 years;;;;;;;;;;Inability to give informed consent;;;;;;;;;;Consumption of caffeine, tea, treatment of dipyridamol <12h before the scan;;;;;;;;;;Medication with calcium antagonists (ok, if can be paused on the day of the scan);;;;;;;;;;Constant medication with nitrates (ok, if can be paused on the day of the scan);;;;;;;;;;Medication with methyl-xanthines;;;;;;;;;;Acute myocardial ischemia/myocardial infarction;;;;;;;;;;Previous Coronary Bypass Surgery;;;;;;;;;;Pulmonary Disease;;;;;;;;;;Enrolment of the investigator, his/her family members, employees and other dependent             persons;;;;;;;;;;Presence of cardiac or lung disease for healthy volunteers, nicotine consumption             within the last 6 months"

The primary hypothesis is that smoking status will influence the antiplatelet effects and      active metabolite concentrations of clopidogrel but will have no impact on prasugrel's      antiplatelet effects or active metabolite concentrations.,thienopyridine;antiplatelet;prasugrel;clopidogrel;,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C1956346;C1519386;C0070166;C1620287;C0004057;C1547311,C1956346;C0031327;C1519386;C0070166;C1620287;C0004057;C1547311;C0332155,C0677599;C0086045;C0086045;C0086045;C0070166;C0070166;C0070166;C0021467;C1620287;C1620287;C1620287;C3244313;C1518681;C0032105;C0947630;C1519386;C1518681;C1518681;C1320102;C1320102;C1320102;C1320102;C4082977;C4082977,C0205042;C0012634,C0003211;C0195495;C0010055;C1257954;C0019168;C0877341;C0162589;C0007787;C0018802;C1956346;C0871470;C0358591;C0009797;C0430064;C0013230;C0040405;C0021900;C4684571;C2746042;C0016018;C0279033;C1527390;C0005779;C0543467;C1458140;C1301624;C0040034;C0015011;C0022885;C0021051;C0004153;C0010075;C0205042;C0813171;C1120149;C0023895;C1120149;C1120149;C0009871;C0232970;C0520483;C1120149;C0005823;C0038358;C0013295;C0032181;C0836924;C0032181;C0055856;C0340288;C0006147;C0700589;C0700589;C0221829;C0700589;C3251812;C0003280;C0040423;C0679637;C0008809;C0907410;C0006949;C0011777;C0700589;C0006147;C0085762;C0020699;C0020538;C0012582;C0050940;C0937846;C0081876;C0014806;C0064113;C0022625;C0004745;C0070166;C0040207;C0162577;C0028778;C0002978;C0015260;C0441290;C0018827;C0003811;C0004083;C0018674;C0018926;C0070166;C0040207;C0378482;C0085228;C0016277;C0016277;C0456984;C0231199;C0070166;C0040207;C0019196;C1301725;C0278329;C1301725;C0037862;C0037862;C3843422;C0019079;C0185115;C1516879;C0055729;C0028978;C0008783;C0002598;C0525005;C0286738;C0068485;C0003241;C0199230;C1620287;C0199230;C0199230;C0011980;C0042387;C0012634;C0002978;C2698969;C0199230;C0199230;C0087111;C0242114;C0014591;C0018965;C0199230;C1514811;C0199230;C1620287;C0199230;C0087111;C0014912;C0376637;C0292818;C1697779;C0424092;C0032961;C0199230;C0020517;C1620287;C1514811;C1514811;C0199230;C0184661;C0018787;C1446409;C0205160;C0549206;C0006104;C0005847;C0392148;C0019080;C0392148;C0019080;C0392148;C0016658;C0043031;C0035608;C4684790;C0549206;C1446409;C1446409;C1446409;C0003241;C1446409;C0004057;C0087111;C0004057;C0040808;C0262512;C1547296;C0087111;C0262512;C0006675;C0018787;C0337664;C0337664;C0025663;C0009653;C0025663;C0262512;C0262512;C0262512;C0262512;C0262512;C0262512;C0262926;C0262512;C0012634;C0262512;C0262512;C0262512;C0262926;C0087111;C0019134;C3540008;C3540008;C3812897;C0425382;C0004057;C0012634;C0944911;C0025663;C0229992;C0038454;C0025222;C0205082;C1553386;C0205082;C3263723;C0005558;C3244286;C1301584;C1301584;C1578434;C0242456;C1512346;C0947630;C1512346;C0038257;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0038257;C0018787;C0178784;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0229671;C3244317;C0005615;C0229671;C0947630;C0947630;C1299581;C4321237;C0441633;C1968515;C1561543;C0013227;C0030605;C1561540;C0013227;C1561538;C1504473;C1301624;C0525032;C0919834;C0919834;C4699604;C0015502;C0935444;C1555587;C0009797;C0948093;C1444662;C4082977;C4082977;C4684637;C3842337;C3842337;C3842337;C3842337;C3842337;C3842337;C4684637;C3842337;C3842337;C2825142;C1320102;C1320102;C0543467;C0022885;C0440280;C1548762;C0022885;C0022885;C4054353;C2924634;C0012000;C1697779;C4048238;C0201913;C0332534;C1706074;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C4331837;C3534109;C0337664;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C2702329;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C2702329;C2702329;C3843395;C2675917;C3899561;C3899561;C0600109;C0728774;C4086490;C3272565;C3272565;C3272565;C3842265;C0332155;C4698437;C4698437;C4698437;C4698437;C2347998;C3654002;C1140618;C4699193;C0151872,,20110901,73.0,5964.0,Completed,23602770,14,14.0,0.008362610851397,0.008262364467278,"Male or female subjects > or = 18 years and <75 years of age;;;;;;;;;;;Weight > or = 60 kg;;;;;;;;;;;On aspirin therapy (81 mg to 325 mg daily) at the time of screening and able to             maintain a consistent aspirin dosing regimen from the baseline visit through the final             study visit;;;;;;;;;;;Subjects who do not have contraindications for a thienopyridine (ie, prasugrel,             clopidogrel, or ticlopidine) and have a history of stable atherosclerosis represented             by CAD, defined as any of the following:;;;;;;;;;;Chronic stable angina;;;;;;;;;;;Documented prior ACS event > or = 30 days before screening and not currently                  prescribed or currently on thienopyridine therapy;;;;;;;;;;;Previous coronary revascularization including percutaneous transluminal coronary                  angioplasty, stent, or coronary artery bypass graft;;;;;;;;;;;Coronary Artery Disease (> or = 40% obstruction) in at least one coronary vessel                  after angiography;;;;;;;;;;;Documented history of positive stress test;

However, it may overestimate the      severity of the stenoses in up to 30% of the coronary artery lesions (positive predictive      value 70%). However, when coupled with a functional or flow-sensitive diagnostic test, such      as PET perfusion or coronary doppler ultrasonography, one can assume that even the PPV may be      as high as 95 %.

Pycnogenol® has prevented pathologic symptoms such as chronic inflammation      and increased platelet aggregation, a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The      endothelium is increasingly recognized not only a target (with vascular remodelling occurring      in response to an injury and resulting in atherosclerosis), but also a mediator in the      pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Indeed, endothelial cells play an important regulatory role      in the cardiovascular system by the expression of numerous molecules and release of mediators      such as nitric oxide (NO), superoxide and endothelin-1 (ET-1). Data from animal studies, as      well as human studies indicate that Pycnogenol may improve endothelial function, which is a      powerful surrogate for clinical prognosis.",Coronary Artery Disease;endothelial dysfunction;Nitric oxide;,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C1956346;C0072642;C1705273,C1956346;C0072642;C0087111;C0220825;C1705273;C0032042;C1549113;C3810851;C1547311;C0456909;C0947630;C2911690;C3897779,C0007222;C0021376;C0677599;C0004153;C0004153;C3887460;C3255957;C0699748;C0028128;C0035648;C0072642;C0072642;C0185117;C0072642;C0127400;C0033325;C0005847;C1704632;C0127400;C0031843;C1555707;C0680255;C0947630;C0947630;C3263723;C0600138;C1704326;C1457887;C0184511;C2825886;C3272561;C3540698;C4084912;C3272565;C0151576,C0205042;C0012634,C0031048;C0018802;C0455821;C0010054;C0027051;C0001623;C0373595;C0563322;C0003873;C1565489;C0085532;C0581603;C0011849;C1302112;C0080203;C0029216;C0021051;C0020517;C0002965;C0020550;C3887460;C0005823;C0878544;C0020676;C0700589;C0184661;C0020538;C0021368;C0015260;C0020649;C0027059;C0028778;C1301725;C0013227;C0006826;C0072642;C0013146;C0184661;C0332155;C0429964;C0544452;C0019158;C0032961;C1446409;C0729233;C0018787;C1446409;C0262926;C0079595;C0018787;C0543467;C0012634;C0543467;C0087111;C0021641;C0087111;C0002871;C0523459;C4035626;C0001962;C0204695;C0012634;C1547311;C0038454;C0205082;C1553386;C0006141;C1561542;C0947630;C0947630;C0023884;C0018787;C0947630;C1561542;C0024109;C1114365;C0919834;C0919834;C0231221;C0009797;C0018827;C4684637;C1320102;C1320102;C2911690;C4086543;C4048238;C0591863;C1561542;C1561542;C4331837;C2702329;C1553756;C0231221;C3245501;C1140618,C0205042,20091201,,,Completed,22240497,12,12.0,0.010027399982428,0.00748306605858,"History of coronary artery disease (documented by coronary angiogram, nuclear imaging,             positive stress test);;;;;;;;;;Stable cardiovascular medication for at least 1 month;;;;;;;;;;Age ΓëÍ 18 years of age at time of signing the informed consent;;;;;;;;;;Informed consent for participation in the study","Myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke (within 3 months before randomization);;;;;;;;;;Thoracic or cardiac surgery and/or coronary intervention/revascularisation procedure             (within 3 months before randomization);;;;;;;;;;Uncontrolled symptomatic congestive heart failure (NHYA> II) in the last 4 weeks prior             to study;;;;;;;;;;Renal insufficiency (Creatinine Clearance < 50ml/min);;;;;;;;;;Ventricular tachyarrhythmias;;;;;;;;;;Poorly controlled hypertension, defined as resting blood pressure ΓëÍ 160/100 mmHg;;;;;;;;;;Symptomatic hypotension;;;;;;;;;;Obstructive cardiomyopathy, active myocarditis, constrictive pericarditis, untreated             hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and adrenal insufficiency;;;;;;;;;;Severe uncorrected valvular disease or left ventricular outflow obstruction, which, in             the opinion of the investigator, requires surgery;;;;;;;;;;Long acting nitrates;;;;;;;;;;Oral or intravenous steroids therapy;;;;;;;;;;Insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus;;;;;;;;;;Recipient of any major organ transplant (eg, lung, liver, heart) or renal replacement             therapy;;;;;;;;;;Malignancy (unless healed or remission > 5 years);;;;;;;;;;Anaemia (Hb< 10g/dl);;;;;;;;;;Known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive or active virus - hepatitis;;;;;;;;;;Alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) > 3 times the upper limit             of the normal range;;;;;;;;;;Known hypersensitivity to Pycnogenol┬«;;;;;;;;;;Alcohol, nicotine abuse or illicit drug abuse;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy or breast-feeding, women with child - bearing potential without adequate             contraception;;;;;;;;;;Disease with systemic inflammation (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, M.

Left untreated, these symptoms not only have a strong negative impact      on quality-of-life, but also increase risk of future cardiac events and death. Unfortunately,      about 64% of CAD patients do not respond to current antidepressant treatments.      Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are two omega-3 (ω-3) fatty acids      found in fatty fish that are important for brain function. Recent evidence showed that      depressed CAD patients have lower levels of EPA and DHA than non-depressed CAD patients. This      information, taken together with the known roles of ω-3 fatty acids in brain function,      suggests that deficiencies may contribute to depression. However, it is unknown if increasing      consumption of ω-3 fatty acids would alleviate depression and improve quality of life. While      intake of adequate levels of ω-3 fatty acids is difficult to obtain through diet,      concentrated supplements containing EPA and DHA that are safe, readily available, and      inexpensive are now obtainable in Canada. CAROTID (CAD Randomized Omega-3 Trial In      Depression) will randomize patients with CAD, with and without depressive symptoms, after 6      months of cardiac rehabilitation and usual care to receive either ω-3 fatty acid supplements      or placebo daily during their final 6 months of cardiac rehabilitation. The investigators      hypothesize that CAD patients randomized to receive ω-3 fatty acid supplements will show      greater improvement in depressive symptoms and quality-of-life over time. The investigators      will also evaluate possible improvements in other important determinants of quality of life:      memory and other cognitive abilities.","Fatty Acids, Omega-3;",Cardiovascular Diseases;,C1956346;C0015689;C0011570,C0011570;C0741968;C0015689;C3897779,C1956346;C0700431;C0700431;C0000545;C0012968;C0086132;C0086132;C0518214;C0015689;C0015689;C0518214;C0015689;C0518214;C0518214;C0741923;C0003289;C0087111;C0011570;C0011570;C0011570;C0012634;C0332155;C0344315;C0344315;C0332218;C0205160;C0031843;C0031843;C0332149;C0015689;C1556133;C0741968;C0015689;C0032042;C3245511;C0025260;C0011065;C0006104;C0006104;C0015689;C0015689;C1457887;C0184511;C0392334;C3242430;C1947907;C3844714;C3897779;C4084912;C4084912;C1561542;C1561542;C1880310;C4697803;C0221106;C0220825;C1947943;C1947943;C1947943;C0162538,C0012634;C0003842;C0011579,C0810516;C0013806;C0010054;C0010054;C0042514;C0876926;C0270920;C0338656;C0031212;C0030567;C0020179;C0015689;C0018946;C0005779;C0424000;C0424000;C0338614;C1301624;C0020517;C0019993;C0002965;C0740858;C0019993;C0741923;C0020676;C3887460;C0175636;C0029944;C0035245;C0700589;C0005604;C0006118;C0031809;C0021308;C0011570;C0011570;C0012634;C0036429;C0332167;C4321248;C0011900;C0012634;C0012634;C0020517;C0199230;C0033348;C0392148;C1261287;C0011849;C0205082;C0014544;C0549206;C0549206;C0005847;C0221423;C0262512;C0001962;C0947608;C0262926;C0262512;C0262512;C0600116;C1547311;C0036690;C0022646;C0002871;C0038454;C0025663;C0205082;C0023884;C1546725;C0456387;C0456387;C0947630;C0085110;C3541397;C0162340;C0012634;C1552867;C0009797;C0021102;C1548428;C1548428;C4082977;C4684637;C2328206;C1697779;C0443146;C1947943;C0002978;C3839460;C3272565;C4321248;C1512346;C4331837;C1552839;C3534109;C1880310;C3272565;C0728774,C0015689,20160501,,,Completed,29730646;26379437,3,1.5,0.009493468621318,0.006379350275134,"Language (speaks and understands English);;;;;;;;;;Between 45-80 years old;;;;;;;;;;Stable coronary artery disease (based on no hospitalization for cardiac events for at             least 7 weeks prior);;;;;;;;;;Angiographic documentation of presence and extent of coronary artery disease (number             of vessels involved, extent of stenosis, etc.);;;;;;;;;;Written, informed consent","Significant acute medical illness (sepsis, autoimmune condition, drug overdose,             uncontrolled diabetes, severely disturbed liver, kidney or lung function, anemia,             hypothyroidism);;;;;;;;;;Clinically significant cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination < 24);;;;;;;;;;Other neurologic conditions (Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, history of             epilepsy, birth trauma, significant traumatic brain injury, clinical stroke,             progressive supranuclear paralysis, brain tumour, subdural hematoma, multiple             sclerosis);;;;;;;;;;Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class 4 (indicating unstable angina);;;;;;;;;;Ventricular tachycardia and/or implantable cardioverter defibrillator;;;;;;;;;;Killip class greater than II (indicates high risk of mortality in post-myocardial             infarction group);;;;;;;;;;Premorbid or concurrent psychiatric diagnoses of schizophreniform or bipolar             depressive disorders, current ethanol or substance abuse or any premorbid psychiatric             condition requiring hospitalization;;;;;;;;;;Current use of a concentrated omega-3 fatty acid supplement, or contraindication to             soybean/corn oil;;;;;;;;;;Pregnant women;;;;;;;;;;Women who become pregnant during the course of the study will be excluded immediately.;;;;;;;;;;Women of childbearing potential must be using an approved method of birth control.;;;;;;;;;;Allergies or hypersensitivity to fish;;;;;;;;;;Pre-existing bleeding disorder;;;;;;;;;;History of electroconvulsive therapy.;;;;;;;;;;Suicidal ideation or a history of suicidal ideation/attempts (determined during SCID-I             at screening/baseline visits);;;;;;;;;;Severe depression, defined by Hamilton Depression Rating score >23;;;;;;;;;;Current or history of psychotic episode or personality disorder."
