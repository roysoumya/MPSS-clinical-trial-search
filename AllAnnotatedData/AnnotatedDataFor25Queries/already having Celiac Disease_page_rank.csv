Not only genetic but      also environmental factors play an important role in CD pathogenesis. CD patients have      imbalance in the gut microbiota, they have reduced number of Bididobacterium species in feces      and biopsies.      Up till now, only effective treatment for CD is life long adherence to gluten free diet. If      gluten free diet is not strict that leads over the years to complications of disease, such as      autoimmune diseases, psychiatric diseases, osteoporosis etc. That may be caused by continuous      recirculation of activated immune cells between the inflamed organ and the periphery. To      avoid complications of disease in long term the investigators want to test specific probiotic      bacteria from Bifidobacteria genus, that has has been in vitro studies recognized as      anti-inflammatory.      Hypothesis        1. Children with celiac disease on gluten free diet have a higher level of pro-inflammatory           cytokine (TNF-alpha) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) in comparison with healthy           controls.        2. 3 months after daily probiotic consumption TNF-alpha level decrease and IL-10 level           increase.

The      disease occurs in genetically predisposed individuals after ingestion of foods containing      gluten. Celiac patients can suffer from severe malabsorption syndrome, mainly characterized      by diarrhea and weight loss. The only therapeutic approach currently recognized is a      life-long gluten-free diet.      Specific regions of gluten molecule become recognizable by lymphocytes and activate them, due      to changes made by tissue transglutaminase. These changes consist in the conversion of      specific residues of glutamine into glutamic acid. The consequence is an increased binding      affinity between gluten and histocompatibility molecule (HLA-DQ2), localized on the surface      of the ""antigen presenting cells"" (APC); the exposure of the fragments of modified gluten on      the surface of APC is a phenomenon that eventually activates T lymphocytes.      Recent studies on modified gluten confirmed the hypothesis that it is possible to block the      presentation of gluten to lymphocytes by means of lysine ethyl ester binding exclusively to      those gluten regions responsible for lymphocyte activation.      The enzymatic treatment is performed directly on flour instead of extracted gluten,      maintaining the same anti-inflammatory effectiveness.      The procedure uses a food-grade enzyme, the microbial transglutaminase (mTGasi) isolated from      Streptoverticillium mobarensis, able to catalyze the formation of intermolecular      ""cross-links"" that modify the functional properties of the products.      Objective of the study is to validate the ability of the enzyme treatment of wheat flour with      mTGasi and lysine ethyl ester to block the toxic effect of gluten in celiac patients.",Celiac disease;Gluten-free diet;Wheat flour treatment;Microbial transglutaminase;Lysine Ethyl Ester;Celiac Disease Treatment;,Digestive System Diseases;Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases;,C0007570;C0087111;C0087111;C0024337;C0981883,C0007570;C0087111;C0087111;C0150312;C0024337;C0981883,C0024523;C0149696;C0344351;C0007570;C0061472;C4553491;C0600688;C1262477;C1273518;C0017797;C0486805;C0750484;C0087111;C0184661;C0018017;C0087111;C0011991;C1552740;C0274281;C0332149;C0012634;C0947630;C3245511;C0683278;C0205082;C0024337;C0024337;C0028778;C3244287;C0947630;C1095911;C0028778;C3540798;C1299581;C0033036;C0033036;C0087111;C2698833;C2698833;C2698833;C0003209;C2698833;C1561528;C0233256;C0031843;C0185115;C0183885;C0183885;C0019633;C1552740;C0599990;C0151576,C0007570,C0021390;C0741132;C0344351;C0344351;C1565489;C0007570;C0023895;C0011900;C1704632;C1446409;C0205160;C0036743;C0027651;C0456387;C1561543;C1561543;C0009450;C0681111,C0087111;C0012634,20150801,,,Unknown status,28343108,0,0.0,0.051548242035339996,0.049696371074113,"diagnosis of celiac disease according to ESPGHAN criteria: class III according to             Marsh-Oberhuber classification, clear response to gluten-free diet, serological             antiendomysium and antitransglutaminase antibodies positive results before GFD;;;;;;;;;;;HLA DQ2-DQ8 positive results;;;;;;;;;;;gluten-free diet from at least one year;;;;;;;;;;;negative serology from at least 1 year;",inflammatory bowel diseases;;;;;;;;;;;tumors;;;;;;;;;;;infectious liver disease;;;;;;;;;;;renal impairment.

A parasite's survival relies on its ability to interfere with      the host's immune response. The mechanisms employed to do this are similar to those required      by a person to regulate against the so-called autoimmune disorders, diseases in which the      system turns on itself. The investigators suspect that when parasites are excluded from the      environment, some individuals become sufficiently self-reactive to develop an autoimmune      disease. American researchers have successfully treated patients with Crohn's and ulcerative      colitis using a pig whipworm (Trichuris suis). The investigators have undertaken a similar      preliminary study using a human hookworm in Crohn's patients.      Using a small group of healthy people with celiac disease, the investigators will test if a      human hookworm, Necator americanus, inhibits immune responsiveness to gluten. Celiac disease      is a very common autoimmune-like disease (1% of Americans are affected although only a      minority are aware they have the condition). In this condition, an individual becomes      reactive to gluten, a protein in foods derived from wheat, barley, oats and rye.      What makes celiac disease such a good model for Crohn's disease is that similar immune      changes are common to both, but in celiac disease the people are usually well, are not taking      powerful immune suppressive drugs and the provocative antigens (the molecules that engage the      immune system and provoke the disease) are known and can be excluded or introduced. As well      as being of direct benefit to people with celiac disease, this study may give direction as to      the potential of this parasite to manage inflammatory bowel disease.      People with proven celiac disease who live in Brisbane, a modern Australian city, will be      invited to participate. Enrollment will require that the candidate has been avoiding gluten      for six months.      The study is a blinded study (where the researchers and study subjects do not know who has      gotten the parasites) aimed at comparing the disease activity and immunity after a controlled      breach of the gluten-free diet in individuals with celiac disease, before and after hookworm      infection. The disease severity and the immune system of celiac subjects before and after      being inoculated with N. americanus will be examined using conventional and experimental      investigations. This group's immunity will be compared to that of a group of matched, celiac      control subjects (not infected with hookworm), before and after eating four pieces of      standard white bread each day for three to five days. Twenty people, ten subjects per arm,      will be recruited. Ten larvae initially, then five more after twelve weeks will be placed on      the skin under a light dressing for thirty minutes.      The investigators aim to test whether the hookworm infection will change the immune processes      and suppress gluten sensitivity in people with celiac disease. Outcomes to be measured will      be those that reflect the activity of celiac disease.",Celiac disease;Parasitic infections;necator americanus;Immunity;,Digestive System Diseases;Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases;,C0027529;C0007570;C0020964;C1550655;C0237677,C0027529;C0007570;C2911690;C0020964;C0032042;C0947630;C1550655;C0237677;C3897779,C0021390;C0021832;C0004364;C0019911;C0850024;C0344351;C0010346;C0007570;C0007570;C0007570;C0007570;C0007570;C0007570;C0007570;C0007570;C0007570;C0007570;C1273518;C0041582;C0041582;C1516879;C0018621;C0012634;C0012634;C0009450;C0012634;C1704632;C0557351;C3245501;C0012634;C0040954;C0020964;C0332128;C0020964;C0439663;C2828392;C0013119;C0010346;C0009319;C0012634;C0010346;C0009319;C0010346;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C0558058;C0004096;C0439662;C0439662;C3245511;C1533312;C0439662;C3245511;C0439662;C0439662;C3244286;C0700164;C0439662;C0013470;C0439662;C0541749;C0947630;C1095911;C3161035;C0013227;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C1551994;C0392366;C0870814;C0939905;C0392366;C1561538;C0446516;C1552578;C0241526;C1552867;C1552867;C0042034;C3245501;C0425152;C0443146;C0443146;C0456642;C2911690;C1716046;C2363670;C4050301;C4050301;C0084688;C1561542;C1552839;C1552839;C1552839;C0275586;C4049938;C4049938;C2363670;C0332155;C0033621;C0886384;C1136356;C0084688,C0007570,C0011854;C0162316;C0018889;C0020517;C0001403;C0344351;C0344351;C0036743;C0554101;C0007570;C0424575;C0580327;C0332119;C0021852;C0013227;C0002792;C3714738;C0162340;C1516879;C0021853;C0003241;C0013227;C1516879;C0011900;C0429964;C1285572;C0032961;C0009450;C0009450;C1446409;C1446409;C3272565;C0036743;C0205160;C0205160;C0038317;C3272565;C1446409;C0036743;C0262512;C0004057;C0262512;C0262512;C0262926;C0262926;C0042210;C0005558;C1555670;C0231683;C0360714;C0332148;C0439662;C0205082;C0947630;C0947630;C0015733;C0003211;C0947630;C1442948;C0392366;C2825347;C1550472;C3842337;C0678889;C3844714;C1561542;C1561542;C3534109;C4283785;C4086490;C0084688;C0334473,,20090901,,,Completed,24795483;21408161,83,41.5,0.048512000534679,0.047195345667602,"Diagnosis of celiac disease;;;;;;;;;;Positive tTG (IgA)or positive anti IgA gliadin or anti-endomysial antibody test.;;;;;;;;;;Marsh score ΓëÑ3 on small bowel biopsy (subtotal villous atrophy);;;;;;;;;;Clinical, biochemical or histological improvement on gluten free diet.;;;;;;;;;;Compliance with a gluten-free diet for 6 months lead-in.;;;;;;;;;;Lifestyle & travel history indicative of a low risk for helminthic infection.;;;;;;;;;;Good general health not on immunomodifying agents.;;;;;;;;;;Ability to complete study;;;;;;;;;;Understand study & risks;;;;;;;;;;Social supports;;;;;;;;;;Workplace flexibility;;;;;;;;;;Normal tTG at enrollment (<10 dependent on serology);;;;;;;;;;A HLA-DQ2 phenotype;;;;;;;;;;Negative fecal test for intestinal helminthes.;;;;;;;;;;Negative serological test for anti-strongyloides antibodies","Children (age < 18);;;;;;;;;;Immunomodulating medication in 6 months pre-enrollment;;;;;;;;;;Oral or intramuscular/intravascular steroids;;;;;;;;;;Regular weekly use of aspirin;;;;;;;;;;Regular weekly use of NSAID;;;;;;;;;;Regular weekly use of COXII inhibitors;;;;;;;;;;Regular weekly use of statin medications;;;;;;;;;;Clinical history indicating a likely need to use an immune suppressive agent during             the course of the study.;;;;;;;;;;Unmanaged risk of pregnancy;;;;;;;;;;Past history of infection with helminthes (other than a past history of infection with             the pinworm, Enterobius vermicularis);;;;;;;;;;History of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or Addison's disease;;;;;;;;;;History of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions;;;;;;;;;;Having received a vaccine within the preceding 30 days;;;;;;;;;;Positive strongyloides serology;;;;;;;;;;Iron deficiency anemia"
