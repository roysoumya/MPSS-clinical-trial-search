The blue CVR map will be shown to be predictive of POD      and stroke and ultimately represent a diagnostic test for patients at risk. These blue CVR      maps will enable neurologic risk stratification for patients undergoing major surgery. A      secondary hypothesis is that location and extent of the blue CVR maps will strongly indicate      risk of neurologic sequelae after operative procedures. Background: Major surgery is      associated with a significant risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. POD is a dreaded      complication with such anesthesia and surgery. The prevalence of delirium after cardiac      surgery has been reported to occur in up to 50% of patients. Using a definitive diagnostic      tool such as the Confusion Assessment Method - Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) results in the      higher proportion reported. Delirium is a serious complication that results in prolonged      length of stay, increased health care costs, and higher mortality. As much as $6.9 billion of      Medicare hospital expenditures can be attributed to delirium. At such a cost, better      diagnosis and treatment is urgently needed. Pre-emptive diagnosis leading to better      management of delirium post-operatively is clearly one of the fundamental problems      confronting modern anesthesia and peri-operative medicine.      Specific Objectives: The investigators seek to address (a) the identity of patients who have      the greatest vulnerability to the surgery and (b) investigate the risks and test appropriate      risk mitigations. Understanding POD is of immense import to help control a hospital's      surgical and critical care costs. Patients with neurological consequences including POD often      represent a choke point for optimized critical care utilization. At the very least, improved      understanding and a diagnostic test to highlight patients at risk of POD would be most      welcome. Such an advance would permit rational strategies to limit the problem and allow      better designed therapeutic arcs for patients now known to be at risk. This is especially      important for patients undergoing complicated major surgery and is the focus of this pilot      project.",magnetic resonance imaging;carbon dioxide;abdominal aortic aneurysm;post-op delirium;,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Nervous System Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0011206;C0543467;C0947630;C1550655,C0162871;C0011206;C0809949;C0543467;C0543467;C0005516;C0947630;C1546725;C3810842;C1550655;C1550655,C0543467;C0746864;C0086143;C0086143;C0085559;C0679637;C0679637;C0162340;C0010337;C0010337;C0162340;C0679637;C0009566;C0009566;C0020440;C0086388;C0002903;C0031809;C0376636;C0002903;C0679199;C0805586;C0027627;C0220880;C0009676;C0011900;C0087111;C0011900;C0011206;C1555588;C0011206;C0700287;C0700287;C0011206;C1547152;C0011206;C0011206;C0424215;C0184511;C0543467;C0543467;C0018787;C0543467;C1442065;C0543467;C0033213;C0038454;C0038454;C0562342;C0025663;C0008301;C1509845;C0392366;C1552861;C0087111;C0018017;C1550655;C0033213;C1550655;C2707261;C0011900;C4084912;C0542058;C1254223;C0150312;C0150312;C0013227;C1552740;C0543467;C1660757;C0030201;C0684331;C0151872;C0151576,C0000726;C0162872,C0024117;C0027051;C0002965;C0008909;C0679637;C0015260;C0011900;C0011265;C0566415;C1299581,C0231881;C0011206;C0003483,20180701,,,Unknown status,28868035,2,2.0,0.027145052958784,0.029019372458774,major surgery;;;;;;;;;;able to tolerate CO2 stress test,"diagnosed dementia;;;;;;;;;;unable to have MRI;;;;;;;;;;excessive claustrophobia;;;;;;;;;;unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction (MI);;;;;;;;;;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)"

This form of brain dysfunction occurs in      intensive care unit (ICU) patients in epidemic proportions, and the scope of this problem is      likely to worsen in upcoming years due to the aging of our population and increased      utilization of the ICU. Currently, delirium goes unrecognized and untreated in the vast      majority of circumstances in the ICU unless the patient presents with hyperactive delirium      and agitation. In the latter circumstance, a commonly used typical antipsychotic called      haloperidol is considered the principal agent for treating delirium based largely on      anecdotal evidence to support its usefulness, though no placebo controlled trials exist.      There are no FDA approved medications for delirium. The atypical antipsychotics provide a      promising alternative for the treatment of delirium due to their enhanced beneficial effects      on positive (agitated) and negative (quiet) symptoms proven in mania and schizophrenia,      reduced risk for side effects common to haloperidol such as extrapyramidal symptomatology,      and less potentially lethal heart rhythm disturbances. It is imperative that well-designed      phase II studies to determine proof of principle be conducted.

Electroencephalography      (EEG) appears to be a sensitive tool for the diagnosis of delirium. However, standard EEG      recording with 25 electrodes is labor intensive. We have previously showed that a brief EEG      registration with three electrodes and automatic processing can distinguish patients with      delirium from patients without delirium very well. However, these findings need to be      validated in an unselected population.      The primary objective of this validation study is to investigate the sensitivity,      specificity, and predictive values of the EEG-based delirium monitor (including three      electrodes and a reference electrode) compared to delirium quantification in frail elderly      patients after surgery.      In an international multicenter study, 154 frail elderly patients will be included who will      undergo elective surgery and are expected to remain admitted for at least two postoperative      days. Patients are excluded if communication is not possible or admitted for neurological      surgery.      A five minute EEG registration with the delirium monitor with four electrodes will be      performed prior surgery and three consecutive days after surgery or until discharge. Within      one hour of the EEG recording, the delirium assessment will be performed and recorded on      video, which will be evaluated by delirium experts.

Its      occurrence is associated with worse outcomes of the patients. The pathophysiology of delirium      remains poorly understood. A universal phenomenon is that delirium was frequently identified      in elderly patients after major complicated surgery, but was rarely noted after minor      ambulatory surgery (such as cataract surgery). This indicated that stress response produced      by surgery might have an important role in the pathogenesis of delirium. It has been reported      that, when compared with general anesthesia and postoperative intravenous analgesia,      neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia reduced the occurrence of postoperative complications and      mortality in high risk patients. Combined epidural-general anesthesia is frequently used in      clinical practice. This anesthesia method provides advantages of both epidural and general      anesthesia, i.e. it blocks the afferent pathway of nociceptive stimulus by neuraxial blockade      during and after surgery, and allows patients to endure lengthy complicated operations      without any awareness. The investigators hypothesize that combined epidural-general      anesthesia and postoperative epidural analgesia can decrease the incidence of postoperative      delirium and, thus, improve the prognosis of critically ill elderly patients undergoing major      surgery. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of combined epidural-general      anesthesia/postoperative epidural analgesia and general anesthesia/postoperative intravenous      analgesia on the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing major      surgery.",Elderly;Anesthesia and postoperative analgesia;Postoperative period;Delirium;Postoperative complications;,"Nervous System Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0002903;C0002766;C0011206;C0025663,C1096777;C0002903;C0002766;C0011206;C0025663,C0032787;C0002905;C0002428;C0002915;C0002915;C0002769;C0002769;C0002915;C0007389;C0277785;C0149784;C0010340;C0010340;C0009566;C0699748;C0002903;C0002903;C3244306;C0002903;C0002903;C4316796;C0002766;C0332167;C0004448;C0033325;C0002766;C0011206;C0011206;C0011206;C0011206;C0700287;C0812144;C0237607;C0812144;C0812144;C0011206;C0812144;C0011206;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C3245511;C0025663;C0028778;C1457868;C0947630;C1704326;C1273517;C0013681;C0442797;C0184511;C1518681;C0162340;C1550043;C4084912;C3272565;C1555587;C3540676,C0009566,C0206074;C0002905;C0853389;C0027051;C1306571;C0751429;C0005779;C1565489;C0030567;C0740418;C0340515;C0237167;C1301624;C0302353;C0032181;C0036341;C0033706;C0033706;C0004083;C0031809;C4050412;C0000726;C0549207;C0009450;C0817096;C0184898;C0014544;C0011265;C0812144;C0205161;C0034117;C0543467;C0262512;C0012634;C0262512;C0543467;C0543467;C0566415;C0205082;C3263723;C0205082;C1553386;C0205082;C0036690;C0205082;C1300072;C0018787;C0229671;C0947630;C0012634;C0086960;C1552867;C4284141;C2911690;C0201975;C0681111;C0039989;C0031843;C4055646;C0332534;C4055646;C1561542;C0606665;C3244287;C2702329;C4283785;C1140618,C0009566,20150601,,,Completed,26459347,0,0.0,0.019327156626716,0.022247406428361,"elderly patients (age range 60-90 years),;;;;;;;;;;scheduled to undergo open thoracic or        open abdominal surgery with an expected duration of 2 hours or longer.

The investigators measured plasma melatonin levels 4      times and assessed postoperative delirium using Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive      care unit (CAM-ICU).,postoperative delirium;melatonin;sevoflurane;,"Nervous System Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0004083;C0025219;C0011206;C0032105;C2946261,C0004083;C0074414;C0002903;C0025219;C0011206;C0032105;C2946261,C0002915;C0010340;C0085559;C0009566;C0259945;C0004083;C0074414;C0002903;C0031809;C0025219;C0025219;C0009676;C0011206;C0011206;C0011206;C3245501;C3242376;C0011206;C3245511;C0032105;C0032105;C0025663;C0947630;C1964257;C0162340;C3841798,C0011206,C0206058;C0085559;C0085762;C0074414;C0002903;C0684336;C1546399;C0033975;C0543467;C0262512;C0018767;C0042789;C0013227;C4084914;C3245501;C4055646,,20110101,,,Completed,23312124,7,7.0,0.017686094434479,0.019105910028217,patients over 20 years of age who had undergone elective surgery with sevoflurane             anesthesia and were expected to require postoperative intensive care for more than 48             hours,"emergency surgery, history of psychosis and drug/alcohol abuse, and vision or hearing             impairment"

The aim of the present      project is to investigate risk factors for postoperative delirium in more detail, to evaluate      respective cognitive test systems and to measure EEG activity parallel to patients’ serum      anticholinergic activity. The pathophysiology of delirium is unknown up to now: a possible      dysbalance between cerebral acetylcholine and dopamine concentrations is a likely hypothesis.      Therefore, the measurement of peripheral serum anticholinergic activity could be a new      prognostic factor for evaluation of delirium. Because delirium is also associated with higher      postoperative mortality and morbidity, with delayed functional recovery, and postoperative      delirium makes patient management much more difficult, increases costs, and, above all,      causes severe discomfort to the patient new interdisciplinary diagnostic strategies are      necessary to resolve this problem.",postoperative delirium;psychometric testing;EEG;serum markers;,"Nervous System Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0085559;C0011900;C0011206;C1509845;C0005516,C1140111,C0599766;C1514474;C0242896;C0277785;C0242896;C0085559;C0086045;C0001041;C0035648;C0220825;C0376636;C2364135;C0679199;C0220880;C0332218;C0011206;C0011206;C0011206;C0332149;C0006104;C0013030;C0011206;C0011206;C0011206;C1706244;C0012634;C0543467;C0150312;C1556133;C0033213;C0332148;C0205082;C0229671;C0229671;C0392366;C1578513;C1578513;C0011900;C0202165;C0220825;C4049938;C4554418;C4049938;C4049938;C0011900,C0011206,C0085559;C1546398;C0005847;C0025344;C0018787;C1509845;C4684637,C0005516,20070420,,,Completed,21037129,5,5.0,0.019206649507721,0.018171452016008,All patients at Intensive Care Unit over a defined time period;;;;;;;;;;Over 18 years old,Elective heart and vascular patients
