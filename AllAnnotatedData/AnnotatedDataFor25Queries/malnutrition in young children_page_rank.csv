Acute malnutrition      is a major contributor to under-5 mortality and morbidity in developing countries. While      clinical guidelines for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) have been available for a decade,      research on the management of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) has lagged behind.      Nonetheless, MAM is much more incident than SAM, it increases mortality risk by itself and      requires special nutritional treatment. This study is thus meant to address this major gap,      by testing the relative feasibility, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three innovative      strategies for treating children with MAM aged 6-24 months : a locally produced Ready-to-Use      Therapeutic Food (RUTF), a corn/soy blended flour (CSB++)provided by the World Food Program,      and a specific and context-appropriate child-centred counselling.

Unfortunately many dialysis patients die, so that after 5 years only      less than 35% are still alive. Dialysis patients who appear malnourished or who have muscle      and fat wasting are even more likely to die. Interestingly, among dialysis patients,      minorities (African Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans) usually survive longer than the      non-Hispanic Whites. If the investigators can discover the reasons for these so-called      ""racial survival disparities"" of dialysis patients, the investigators may be able to improve      survival for all dialysis patients and maybe even for many other people who suffer from other      chronic diseases. During this 5 year study the investigators would like to test if a      different nutrition and diet can explain better survival of minority dialysis patients. The      investigators will also test if in additional to nutrition there are 2 other reasons for      better survival of minority dialysis patients, namely differences in bone and minerals and      differences in social and psychological and mental health. The investigators plan to study      450 hemodialysis patients every 6 months in several dialysis clinics in Los Angeles South Bay      area. These subjects will include 30% African Americans, 30% Hispanics, 30% non-Hispanic      Whites and 10% Asians. Every 6 months the investigators will examine their nutritional      conditions, dietary intake, psycho-social conditions and quality of life, and will recruit 75      new subjects to replace those who left our study as a result of kidney transplantation, death      or other reasons. Hence, the investigators estimate studying a total of 1,050 hemodialysis      patients over 5 years. Clinical events such as hospital admissions and survival will be      followed. Blood samples will be obtained every 6 months for measurements of hormones and      ""biomarkers"", and the remainder of the blood will be stored in freezers for future      measurements.

The program will be targeted to economically vulnerable households      with children less than 1 year old at the time of inclusion and the cash distributed to      mothers. The transfers will be assimilated to unconditional ones, leading to beneficiaries'      self-determination on the use that will be made of cash. This study will be designed as a      two-arm cluster randomized intervention trial, based on randomization of rural villages of      the Tapoa province. One arm will receive the intervention and one will be a control arm. The      main outcomes will be the cumulative incidence of acute malnutrition (or wasting) and the      cost-effectiveness. Anthropometric measures (height, weight and MUAC) will be measured, as      well as indicators of dietary diversity, food security, health center frequentation,      families' expenses and morbidities. Questionnaires and 24-hour food recalls will also be      analyzed.

In Austria, the prevalence of frailty and malnutrition are      increasing steadily and are becoming a challenge for our social system. Physical training and      adequate nutrition can invert it.      Methods/Design: In this randomized, controlled trial 80 malnourished, frail,      community-dwelling patients (≥ 65 years) are recruited. Additionally, 80 lay volunteers (≥ 50      years) named buddies are recruited and subsequently trained regarding health enhancing      physical activity and nutrition in three standardized training sessions. These buddies visit      the malnourished, frail subjects at home twice a week for about one hour during an initial      period of 10-12 weeks. While participants allocated to the intervention group (n=40) conduct      intervention to improve their fluid intake, their protein and energy intake, perform strength      training and try to increase their baseline activities, the control group (n=40) only gets      home visits without any special intervention. After 10-12 weeks, both, the intervention and      the control group, receive the nutrition intervention and the physical training. Health,      nutrition and frailty status, physical fitness and body composition and chronic inflammation      of buddies and frails are recorded before the intervention, after 10-12 weeks, and after 6      and 12 months.      Discussion: To the investigators knowledge this trial is the first of its kind to provide      nutrition and physical activity intervention to malnourished, frail, community-dwelling      subjects by trained lay buddies, in which the health status of buddies is also expected to      improve. This study assesses the effectiveness of such an intervention. If successful, the      intervention offers new perspectives for the management of frailty and malnutrition.",frailty;community-dwelling;malnutrition;physical activity;nutritional intervention;,Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases;,C0871754;C0162429;C2947996,C0086153;C0031809;C1554161;C0871754;C0162429;C3694424,C0021629;C0021376;C0518214;C4553491;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0184661;C0184661;C0429791;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0162429;C0184661;C0184661;C0162429;C0020043;C0011546;C0376636;C0220880;C0805586;C0392209;C0392209;C0392209;C0392209;C0376554;C0392209;C0031809;C0424594;C0424594;C0025663;C0424594;C0424594;C3245511;C0025344;C0424589;C0871754;C0027365;C1512346;C0871754;C0871754;C0947630;C1442948;C1561540;C1578513;C4699604;C0442694;C4699618;C0442694;C0442694;C0442694;C0282440;C0080194;C0184511;C1555587;C0080194;C0184511;C1328956;C0557061;C0178520;C0178520;C0311392;C0683314;C3694424;C0233697;C3694424;C4055646;C0182647;C1552839;C1552839;C1552839;C0018792;C0221106;C4288557;C0728774;C0031809;C0182913;C0033621;C0701928;C0015421,C0162429,C0392335;C0872279;C0011849;C1301624;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0184661;C0557834;C0162340;C0184666;C1318963;C0011946;C0442711;C0028678;C0006147;C0021641;C0595998;C0006826;C0684240;C0684240;C1519316;C0871754;C0871754;C0871754;C0871754;C1300072;C0947630;C3843802;C0012621;C4699618;C0009797;C0870312;C3694424;C1561542;C1555709;C1552839;C0031809;C0033348;C4698437;C4698437;C0332155,C0184661,20151201,,,Completed,30094663;28724351;24369785,13,4.33333333333333,0.021010072942096,0.022387952303038,65 years or older;;;;;;;;;;Living in Vienna;;;;;;;;;;Hospital discharged planned for the next 14 days;;;;;;;;;;Malnutrition or at risk of malnutrition according to the MNA-SF;;;;;;;;;;Frail or pre-frail according to the SHARE-FI;;;;;;;;;;Community-dwelling;;;;;;;;;;No medical contraindication for the performance of physical strength training;;;;;;;;;;Able to walk (with or without a walking aid);;;;;;;;;;Capability to consent,65 years or younger;;;;;;;;;;Admission to nursing home is planned;;;;;;;;;;Nursing level 6 or 7;;;;;;;;;;Cancer according to the medical charts;;;;;;;;;;Insulin treated diabetes mellitus according to the medical charts;;;;;;;;;;COPD stage III or IV;;;;;;;;;;Dialysis patient;;;;;;;;;;Cannot understand the German language;;;;;;;;;;Impaired cognitive function according to the MMSE (Γëñ 17 points)        Inclusion Criteria buddies:;;;;;;;;;;50 years or older;;;;;;;;;;Signed informed consent;;;;;;;;;;Readiness to participate in the study as well in the intervention as in the control             group;;;;;;;;;;Commitment to keep to the protocol for at least 6 months

The management of malnutrition has an impact in reducing postoperative      complications. However malnutrition is rarely detected and Guidelines infrequently followed.      Recovery time and nutritional evaluation in elderly patients are major criteria in their      postoperative management. Identifying malnutrition or malnutrition risk is fundamental to its      treatment. It is therefore unsurprising that many validated tools for nutrition risk      screening and nutrition assessment exist for the clinician to use in assisting with the      accurate identification, referral and treatment of patients who are malnourished or at risk      of malnutrition.      And nutritional management must be adapted and based on this evaluation and evolution of the      general status (Guidelines Grade A).      A geriatric evaluation based on a screening of preoperative malnutrition should allow a      better implementation of the European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN)      guidelines.",vulnerable;nutrition;cancer;colorectal;tumor;,Neoplasms;Digestive System Diseases;Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases;,C0162429;C0162429;C2707262;C0220825;C0220908;C0543467;C0947630;C1550655;C1112501,C0162429;C0162429;C2707262;C0220825;C0220908;C0543467;C0947630;C1550655;C1112501,C0014327;C0009566;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0376636;C0162791;C0220825;C0376636;C0031809;C0376636;C0220825;C0162791;C0220825;C2359959;C0162791;C0000726;C0220880;C0087111;C0392209;C0199230;C0392209;C1550470;C0557034;C0087111;C0199230;C0442726;C2004454;C0034927;C0543467;C2948499;C0020792;C0947124;C2707262;C2707262;C0732248;C0015733;C0286840;C1254223,C0027651,C1519810;C0027627;C0027627;C0015252;C1546844;C0015252;C0027651;C0027651;C0027651;C1547530;C1547530;C1112501,,20170101,,,Unknown status,28061830,0,0.0,0.019430918160453,0.021937786674151003,Aged ΓëÑ 70 years;;;;;;;;;;Colorectal or tumor resection with/without synchronous metastases,Emergency resection of colorectal tumor;;;;;;;;;;Unresectable colorectal tumor with/without synchronous metastases

Physiologically, malnourished children excrete lower amounts of salts      and water in diarrhoeal stools, and they also are unable to handle excessive salts and water      load. Some times they are found to be hyponatraemic due to the shift of sodium inside the      cells (inefficient Na+ /K+ pump), and fluids containing higher amounts of sodium (such as the      standard ORS) may lead to further increase in the intracellular sodium, fluid overload and      heart failure. They also have depleted in potassium stores in the body. Recently, the WHO      recommended a special ORS formulation, known as ReSoMal, for management of diarrhoea in      severely malnourished children that contains a lower amount of sodium (45mmol/L) and higher      amount of potassium (40 mmol/L) than the standard WHO-ORS. It is felt that an ORS containing      lower sodium and higher potassium concentration may be useful in correcting hypokalemia, and      in lowering the risks of excess sodium and /or overhydration, in severely malnourished      children with diarrhoea. The safety of ReSoMaL is, however, still in question due to the risk      of hyponatraemia, including symptomatic hyponatraemia, especially in the treatment of severe      watery diarrhoea due to Vibrio cholerae and ETEC where loss of sodium in the stool exceeds      than that is contained in ReSoMal. Thus an ORS solution with modest concentration of sodium      (75 mmol/L) and higher concentration of potassium (40 mmol/L) have been suggested for the      treatment of diarrhoea in these children. To improve the efficacy of oral rehydration, in      terms of reducing the severity of purging and diarrhoea duration, different approaches      (changing the substrates/ reducing the sodium and glucose concentration and osmolarity) have      been tried with limited success. Benefiber (partially hydrolysed guar gum), a soluble fiber      if added to a ORS solution is expected to be fermented in the colon liberating short chain      fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs stimulate sodium and water absorption from the colon, and they      have trophic effect, act as a fuel source for the colonocytes, have antibacterial properties      and stimulates the production commensal flora, thereby may enhance recovery from acute      diarrhoea in severely malnourished children. The aims of our proposed study are to examine      whether an ORS solution with a modest concentration of sodium will prevent the occurrence of      hyponatraemia including symptomatic hyponatraemia, and also whether addition of benefiber      will improve the efficacy of ORS solution. This will be a randomized, double blind,      controlled clinical trial in 186 children with severe malnutrition and watery diarrhoea (62      in each of the three treatment groups) to compare the efficacy of (i) the currently      recommended ORS with some modofication(Na+ 75 mmol/L and K40 momol/L and minerals-Zinc,      copper and magnesium), (ii) ReSoMal (Na+ 45 mmol/L), (iii) Currently recommended ORS (Na+ 75      mmol/L, K 40 momol/L and added minerals) with added Benefiber (25 grams/L), in the treatment      of acute watery diarrhoea in children with severe malnutrition",Diarrhoea;;Severe malnutrition;;Benefiber;;ReSoMal;;modified ORS;,"Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases;",C0205082;C0162429,C0086904;C0086904;C0220825;C0087111;C0011991;C0061996;C0205082;C0162429;C0043047,C0936233;C0427743;C0311276;C0311276;C0086904;C0546817;C0857122;C0018801;C0086045;C0020488;C0392689;C0020625;C0020625;C0086045;C0086045;C0279516;C0086045;C0020625;C0020625;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C1273518;C0020621;C0376636;C0029387;C2347023;C0011991;C0221423;C0032821;C0011991;C0032821;C0032821;C0011991;C0087111;C0011991;C0032821;C0087111;C0011991;C0011991;C1828805;C0011991;C0011991;C0087111;C1828805;C0087111;C0011991;C2828392;C0205082;C2828392;C0205082;C0061996;C0205082;C0221102;C0078516;C0855227;C3245511;C0011065;C0015733;C0566415;C0205082;C1518681;C0449416;C1552839;C0009968;C0043047;C0043047;C0015733;C0225326;C0009368;C0043047;C0009368;C0947630;C0456909;C0182537;C1442948;C0043481;C0231221;C0231221;C0011991;C1820370;C0008354;C0544691;C2004454;C0184511;C0151514;C0000589;C0184511;C0668326;C0668326;C0668326;C0668326;C0035150;C1828805;C0373675;C0332534;C4055646;C0449878;C0449878;C0043047;C0043047;C0043047;C0776963;C0776963;C0776963;C1701972;C4025593;C0231184;C1522634;C0701928;C3834249;C0220644;C3536899,,C0278384;C0476273;C0424670;C0085559;C0011175;C0162791;C0025289;C0004048;C0011991;C0032285;C0012634;C0205082;C0015733;C0205082;C0205082;C0036690;C0013604;C0005767;C0026727;C0013227;C0009797;C4086490;C3272565,,20090701,,,Completed,26825757,1,1.0,0.031490298974886,0.021832903508975,Some or severe dehydration (assessed by WHO Guidelines).;;;;;;;;;;Weight for height (W/H) <70% of NCHS median or with bipedal edema.;;;;;;;;;;Written informed consent from parents/ guardians,"Blood or mucus in stools;;;;;;;;;;Have received antidiarhoeal drugs for their diarrhoea;;;;;;;;;;Severe diseases (e.g. severe pneumonia with respiratory distress, clinical sepsis,             meningitis) requiring intensive care and other ancillary support like O2 inhalation,             oropharyngeal suction etc."

In a healthy person oxidants      are made harmless because another compound called glutathione neutralizes them. Glutathione      is made from three amino acids that we get from the protein we eat in our food. We found that      malnourished children were not making enough glutathione because they lacked one of these      amino acids called cysteine. In this study we determine why malnourished children do not have      sufficient cysteine, and we will feed malnourished children a whey-based diet which is rich      in cysteine during their treatment to determine whether they will make more glutathione. This      in turn may make their organs recover faster. These findings will let us know whether      malnourished children can recover faster if they are given more cysteine during the early      phase of treatment.",glutathione kinetics;oxidant damage;anti-oxidant capacity;oxidative stress;cysteine kinetics;severe childhood malnutrition;,Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases;,C0003402;C0947630;C0162429,C0022806;C0268519;C0001117,C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0002520;C0002520;C0087111;C0087111;C0205082;C2004454;C2004454;C0178784;C0178784;C0178784;C0947630;C3244317;C3540798;C0541749;C0037088;C0010124;C0620376;C0268519;C0620376;C0620376;C0043474;C0010682;C0010682;C0010682;C0010682;C0033621;C4082977;C4082977,C0162429;C4330907,C0033677;C0022806;C0022806;C0683278;C0205082;C1561542,C0162429;C0620376;C0220644,20160101,,,Completed,22170355,3,3.0,0.021004837586415,0.020818398324105,"Infants and toddlers, 6-18 months of age;;;;;;;;;;Suffering from severe protein-energy malnutrition, kwashiorkor and             marasmic-kwashiorkor",

Malnutrition may be      linked to more than one half of the deaths in children under 5 years old. In July 2001, after      an intervention related to a measles epidemic, Medecins sans Frontieres-France opened a      nutritional program in Maradi, in the South of Niger. The introduction of ready to use      therapeutic foods (RUTF), in particular Plumpy'Nut (Nutriset, France) allowed for the      treatment of the majority of children at their homes using ambulatory treatment. Children      with complicated cases were cared for in an inpatient center. With ambulatory treatment the      number of children cared for in the MSF program reached close to 70000 in 2006.      This study aimed to assess the effect of a 3-month distribution of RUTF in the context of a      preventative supplementary feeding program. The primary hypotheses were that short-term RUTF      supplementation at the village-level would prevent declines in weight-for-height and reduce      the incidence of wasting in children 6 to 60 mo of age over a period of 8 mo. Because RUTF      may have additional health effects, the intervention effect on height-for-age, stunting,      mortality and morbidity from malaria, diarrhea, and respiratory infection were also examined.",malnutrition;ready to use food;Niger;,Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases;,C0733511;C0162429,C0199176;C0733511;C0162429;C1547229,C0035243;C0242297;C0699943;C0162429;C0162429;C0184661;C0184661;C1561560;C1561560;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0220880;C0011991;C0332128;C0033213;C0025007;C0542559;C0204695;C0235394;C0024530;C0011065;C1518681;C1305866;C0025344;C1518681;C0947630;C0087111;C0376495;C1378698;C2707262;C0233492;C1518681;C0015726;C0015726;C1547298;C0018273;C3842265,C0162429,C1561542;C1549439,,20080301,,,Completed,19155454,26,26.0,0.027172709140365004,0.019976628161367,All children resident in randomized villages 6-59 months,

However, available criteria for defining malnutrition in paediatric patients are      inconsistent, not based on firm evidence, and not generally agreed upon. Current guidelines      do not address assessment of and screening for childhood malnutrition. Therefore, a large      number of affected children are not adequately diagnosed.      One aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of malnutrition and patients at risk for      malnutrition among at least 2700 hospitalized children mainly across Europe. In addition      criteria to link anthropometric measurements and the prediction of outcome, i.e. length of      hospital stay, shall be established. A further goal then is to establish agreed,      evidence-based criteria for malnutrition in children with the purpose of leading to an      agreed, evidence-based screening tool for paediatric malnutrition in developed countries.      This tool shall include a set of simple questions, based on previously suggested tools.

An estimated 20% of children in the developing world are malnourished      [1] and poor nutrition is linked to more than half of all child deaths worldwide [2].      Malnutrition in early childhood may lead to cognitive and physical deficits and may cause      similar deficits in future generations as malnourished mothers give birth to low birth weight      children [3]. In addition, malnutrition increases susceptibility and incidence of infections      and is associated with diminished response to vaccines.      The MAL-ED Project is designed to determine the impact of enteric infections/diarrhea that      alter gut function and impair children's nutrition, growth and development to help develop      new intervention strategies that can break the vicious enteric infection-malnutrition cycle      and reduce its global burden.      The overall objective of the MAL-ED Project is to quantify the associations of specific      enteric pathogens, measures of physical and mental development, micronutrient malnutrition,      gut function biomarkers, the gut microbiome, and immune responses in very young children in      resource-limited settings across eight sites that vary by culture, economics, geography, and      climate.      The central hypothesis of the MAL-ED Project is that infection (and co-infection) with      specific enteropathogens leads to impaired growth and development and to diminished immune      response to orally administered vaccines by causing intestinal inflammation and/or by      altering intestinal barrier and absorptive function. Data analyses will test for associations      between enteropathogen infections and growth/development to help illuminate:        -  which micro-organisms or mixed infections are most frequently associated with growth           faltering and poor development; and        -  at what age specific infections cause the most disruption to growth and development and           impair immune response.",Cognitive development;Diarrheal disease;Enteric infections;Malnutrition;Vaccine Response;Enteropathy;Antibiotic use;Micronutrients;Breast feeding;Gut inflammation;,"Bacterial Infections and Mycoses;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases;",C0162429;C0008078;C0678723;C0851162;C0699268,C0035648;C0162429;C0008078;C0678723;C0851162;C0699268,C0018271;C0018271;C0018271;C0599735;C0018271;C0024032;C0162429;C0012655;C0162429;C0035648;C0162429;C0524343;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0184661;C0162429;C0162429;C0021368;C0243107;C3714514;C3714514;C0679199;C0005516;C0021853;C0021853;C3714514;C3714514;C3714514;C0220880;C0392209;C0009450;C0018017;C0009450;C0009450;C1704632;C0042210;C0011991;C0031843;C1552740;C0031843;C1552740;C1704632;C0042210;C0031843;C1552740;C1704632;C1706912;C0439662;C0439662;C0018270;C0439662;C0005615;C1442948;C1552861;C0392366;C1552861;C0699819;C1578513;C0699819;C0699819;C0004083;C0004083;C1704632;C0542559;C0011164;C3539125;C3845919;C0311392;C0441229;C0056685;C0031809;C0016538;C2363670;C0016538;C3834249;C0282547;C0016538;C0220644;C4082977,,C0264716;C0019993;C0010674;C0022658;C0023895;C0032961;C0012634;C0011900;C0011900;C0012634;C0012634;C0205082;C0205082;C0566415;C0947630;C0005615;C0005615;C3649644;C0741302;C1555587;C0009797,C0021368,20170401,,,Unknown status,29684739;28592604;28381477,5,1.6666666666666698,0.017557701305417,0.019526609202791,Less than 17 days old.,"Mother is less than 16 years of age.;;;;;;;;;;Mother has another child inthe MAL-ED study.;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy resulted in multiple birth (e.g., twins).;;;;;;;;;;Child has a severe disease requiring hospitalization for something other than for a             typical healthy birth.;;;;;;;;;;Child has a severe or chronic condition diagnosed by a medical doctor (e.g., neonatal             disease, renal disease, chronic heart failure, liver disease, cystic fibrosis,             congenital conditions).;;;;;;;;;;Child has enteropathies diagnosed by medical doctor.;;;;;;;;;;Mother is living and unable to provide informed consent."

It is hypothesised that co-trimoxazole      prophylaxis will have a similar effect in children immunocompromised because of severe      malnutrition.

The study      will be conducted in Isiolo County, Kenya. The study builds on the recent approach of      training mothers to screen for acute malnutrition in their own children (mother MUAC      approach).      The primary aim of the study is to describe and compare the performance of a set of three      prototype Click-MUAC devices against a gold standard of classification, in terms of measures      of agreement (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, Youden's J) for the      classification (diagnosis) of acute malnutrition.

The hypothesis of the study is that at least one of the Click-MUAC prototypes is      equal to the gold standard of classification in terms of measures of agreement for the      classification of acute malnutrition. A secondary hypothesis of the study is that agreement      with the gold standard classification is better amongst mothers/caregivers using a Click-MUAC      prototype compared to mothers/caregivers using a regular MUAC tape.
