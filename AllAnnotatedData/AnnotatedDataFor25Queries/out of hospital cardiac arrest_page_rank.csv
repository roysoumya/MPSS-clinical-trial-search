Recent studies have showed that      the high quality of CPR increases the survival after cardiac arrest. Therefore the      investigators planned this prospective observational study to determine the epidemiology of      sudden cardiac arrest in the prehospital setting of Tampere area, the quality of the CPR, and      also the associations between depth and frequency of chest compressions and invasive arterial      pressure, EtCO2,cerebral oxygenation and iatrogenic injuries associated to chest compressions      1) in patients resuscitated out of hospital by emergency medical service's (EMS's) personals      and 2) in-hospital by hospital resuscitation team members. In addition, the investigators      will analyze the effects of the chosen method of resuscitation on critical vital signs (Etco2      and invasive pressures): closed-chest CPR is compared to open-chest CPR, or mechanical CPR      with a device (AutoPulse-CPR, Cardio Pump) compared to manual CPR guided with quality CPR      device. The results will give the investigators important insights into the haemodynamics of      CPR which may guide future strategies for the management of cardiac arrest.

Thus, less than 20 % of patients discharged home with impaired quality of      life associated with symptoms of tiredness, stress, anxiety. The prognosis is related to the      initial cardiac rhythm present during the initiation of resuscitation. Recent progress in the      improvement of mortality and neurological outcome has been achieved over the last decade      thanks to the systematic implementation of a period of targeted temperature control between      32 and 34 ° C in patients who benefited from the realization of at least one electrical      external shock.      There are theoretical and clinical arguments to think that achieving the same way a period of      targeted temperature control between 32 and 34 ° C in patients treated for cardiac arrest      with a non- shockable rhythm on arrival can also benefit from this procedure. However other      arguments are against this hypothesis including an increase in the risk of infection ,      worsening of the patient's hemodynamic status with no benefit to him. To answer this      question, we conduce a randomized multicenter study testing the potential improvement of      neurological outcome through this procedure targeted temperature control between 32.5 and      33.5 ° C in these patients.",Therapeutic hypothermia;Targeted controlled temperature;Cardiac arrest;Non shockable rhythm;successful resuscitation;,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0020674;C0018790;C0871269,C0020674;C0018790;C0871269;C0947630,C0018790;C0018790;C0035273;C1273518;C4281788;C0231170;C0589507;C0015672;C0033325;C0184661;C0009450;C0184661;C0150312;C0018787;C0003467;C0018787;C0150312;C0392366;C0011065;C0038435;C0871269;C0025344;C0025344;C0871269;C0036974;C0039869;C0947630;C1561543;C0012621;C1457887;C2707261;C2707261;C0233754;C0018790;C0233492;C0020796;C3844714;C3844714;C1328018;C1548801;C3272565;C1522634;C0332155,C0018787,C0948268;C2986535;C0018790;C0018790;C0018790;C0220825;C0023890;C0549206;C0442711;C1550655;C0871269;C4321351;C1114365;C0009797;C2707261;C3534109;C3534109,C0035273;C0087111;C2911690,20180409,,,Completed,25882712,9,9.0,0.018808694489162,0.018760361189701,Cardiac arrest in non shockable rhythm;;;;;;;;;;Glasgow score ΓëÁ 8,"No flow > 10 min;;;;;;;;;;Low flow > 60 min;;;;;;;;;;Major hemodynamic instability;;;;;;;;;;Delay between cardiac arrest and inclusion > 300 min;;;;;;;;;;Cirrhosis Child C;;;;;;;;;;Age < 18 years;;;;;;;;;;Pregnant women;;;;;;;;;;Patient with no liberty;;;;;;;;;;Lack of informed consent;;;;;;;;;;Prior inclusion in a research protocol involving cardiac arrest with draw, and whose             primary endpoint focuses on the evaluation of a neurological score Day 90"

We will compare the ability of this tool to      predict clinical deterioration compared to accepted physiology-based tools and tools      combining judgment and physiology as well as other markers of deterioration such as physician      order changes. We will compare the sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve of these      combined models to the predictive models including only physiology or clinical judgment. We      will assess the correlation between specific physician orders and patient deterioration to      determine whether specific clinical activities, such as emergently obtained radiology exams,      predict impending deterioration. We hypothesize that PAR will be a useful tool for predicting      clinical deterioration across the institution and that it will have a higher average accuracy      for predicting clinical deterioration in non-ICU inpatients within 24 hours than the      physiology-based tools alone. We further hypothesize that a combined metric which includes      both the PAR and the individual physiologic components that comprise physiologic tools will      not significantly improve prediction over the PAR alone. We further propose to use PAR to      prospectively risk stratify patients for preemptive evaluation by the Rapid Response Team. We      hypothesize that intervening on high risk patients by preemptively activating the hospital's      Rapid Response Team (to assess and treat patients as needed) will decrease cardiac arrest      rates and mortality.",,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0018790;C1550655;C0012082,C1881154;C0679199;C0012082,C0085559;C0018790;C0018790;C1457868;C0031843;C0031843;C0031843;C0031843;C0220825;C0022423;C0043299;C0332167;C0022423;C0022423;C1552740;C1552740;C1704632;C1704632;C1550655;C3244315;C0699680;C0947630;C0947630;C0439044;C0439044;C0728827;C0442797;C0184511;C0237677;C1546848;C4684637;C0005516;C0277591;C4698437;C0804815;C0804815;C3161035;C3161035;C0015733;C0015733;C1522411;C0015733;C0015733;C0729829;C0220825;C3272565;C3272565;C3272565;C3272565;C3272565;C3272565;C3272565;C0031843;C0031843;C4082977,C0018790,C3840862,C1140111,20131201,,,Withdrawn,23129163,2,2.0,0.020039718702604,0.018324698314783,Non-ICU ward inpatients;;;;;;;;;;PAR of 5 or above;;;;;;;;;;Ages 18+ years,ICU or outpatients;;;;;;;;;;PAR of 4 or lower;;;;;;;;;;Ages 17 years and under

The majority of these deaths takes place outside hospital as sudden cardiac death. However,      with immediate (within minutes) actions such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and      defibrillation many lives would be saved. CPR is a key factor to increase survival from Out      of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA). CPR buys time by supporting the brain with some      circulation in waiting for a defibrillator that can restart the heart. In Sweden about 2,5      million people are trained in CPR. However, only about half of all OHCA victims will get CPR      in waiting for ambulance arrival.      The aims of the Response to Urgent Mobile message for Bystander Activation (RUMBA) trial is      to try a new way of logistics to increase bystander CPR by recruiting lay volunteers to      nearby OHCAs via their mobile phones.
