Ephedrine and caffeine (EC) combination has been widely used in human obesity treatment. It      is known that this drug increases the metabolic rate in both animals and humans. Ephedrine is      an agonist of both α and β-adrenoceptors; moreover, it induces norepinephrine release from      sympathetic neurons. Caffeine increases both norepinephrine and dopamine release and      stimulates the neuronal activity in several brain regions. We hypothesize that EC treatment      might exert a specific effect on lipolysis and thermogenesis by stimulation of beta-3      adrenoreceptors on adipose tissue and by stimulating uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation,      i.e. energy being dissipated as heat rather than being converted to adenosine triphosphate      (ATP)      Our study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week trial to investigate the effect of      hypocaloric diet alone or coupled to EC treatment of morbidly obese women on thermogenesis,      expression of UCP 3 (in muscle tissue) and of beta-3 adrenoreceptors (in adipose tissue).

Post menopausal status is assumed if a woman has not experienced a             menstrual bleed for a minimum of 12 months, assuming that she still has a uterus, and             is not pregnant or lactating. In women without a uterus, menopause or postmenopause is             defined by a very high FSH level.          -  All patients should fulfil the diagnostic criterion of abdominal adiposity: waist             circumference > 102 cm (men) or > 88 cm (women).

High blood pressure often occurs in people who are overweight. These people frequently also      have abnormal fat and sugar metabolism. The combination of these problems is called the      'metabolic syndrome'.      People with hypertension and obesity currently receive the same drug therapy as people with      hypertension, but without obesity. Different classes of drugs are thought to be equally      effective in lowering blood pressure.      Next to lowering blood pressure, hypertension treatment can have additional effects, like      changes in blood vessel function (the ability to dilate and constrict) or changes is the      metabolism of sugar and fat. Particularly in patients with the metabolic syndrome, these      additional effects are thought to be of great importance, because they can influence the risk      for cardiovascular diseases.      The blood pressure lowering mechanism differs between classes of blood pressure lowering      medication. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of three types of blood      pressure lowering medication belonging to different classes. The main outcomes of interest      will be blood vessel function (the ability to dilate and constrict) and blood pressure.      Moreover, the effect of treatment on additional outcomes, like metabolism of sugar and fat,      will be studied.",Hypertension;Metabolic Syndrome X;Obesity;Adiposity;Clinical trial;,"Cardiovascular Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases;",C0087111;C0233492;C0028754,C0020261;C0020538;C0277785;C0066837;C1120110;C0032042;C0028754;C0456909;C0947630;C0233492;C2911690;C3897779,C0007222;C0578998;C0027051;C0020538;C0020538;C0524620;C0524620;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0020538;C0020538;C0013216;C0020538;C0005847;C0005847;C0497406;C0025519;C0025519;C0013227;C0013227;C0025519;C0087111;C0205161;C0031843;C0460139;C0543488;C0031843;C0028754;C0028754;C0456387;C0456387;C0456387;C0038454;C0700124;C0700124;C1518681;C0242209;C0013227;C0242209;C0947630;C0005767;C0242209;C0015677;C0015677;C0015677;C3539181;C1820370;C1820370;C1820370;C1820370;C1820370;C0033213;C1518681;C1518681;C1518681;C4084912;C0009813;C0009813,C0000726;C0039082;C0028754,C0020517;C0428883;C0428883;C0018802;C3541276;C0024523;C0488055;C0520679;C0155616;C0004245;C0455829;C0542495;C0004936;C0524620;C0003811;C0003364;C0042373;C0037188;C0003364;C0578022;C3245491;C0302592;C0001617;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0152025;C0206159;C0202041;C0085762;C0034394;C0700589;C0232973;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0232197;C0223651;C0231199;C0428977;C0277785;C0000970;C0005775;C0005775;C0025320;C0025320;C0162791;C1704788;C0087111;C0439857;C0013227;C0022885;C0518015;C0162791;C0003811;C4050412;C0006826;C0220825;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0683312;C0004048;C0013227;C0025344;C0025320;C0442804;C0000726;C0028754;C0011900;C0036806;C0199230;C0032821;C1514892;C0012634;C0242114;C0199230;C0087111;C0003968;C0460139;C0460139;C0012798;C0039082;C0039082;C0031843;C0012634;C0012634;C1550655;C0038293;C0015663;C0017725;C0015663;C1550655;C0262512;C0262926;C0199168;C1551395;C0012634;C0027769;C0017725;C0038317;C0042131;C0042131;C0337443;C0018792;C0006826;C0025344;C0243144;C0233601;C0243144;C0019080;C0230097;C0005767;C0005767;C1512346;C1512346;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C0947630;C0023884;C0456387;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0456387;C0028429;C0446516;C4321237;C1561543;C1273517;C0018026;C0182537;C1442948;C1442948;C1561538;C0035561;C0446516;C0446516;C4321351;C0175306;C0050451;C0152325;C0015392;C0020557;C0237607;C0162340;C0184661;C0012634;C4699604;C1820370;C1820370;C0679228;C0679228;C1550655;C0009797;C0009797;C0009797;C0009797;C0201950;C1444783;C4082977;C4684637;C3842337;C2328206;C1320102;C1320102;C3809765;C0681111;C0202165;C0202165;C2828358;C4086543;C4300452;C0231519;C0043474;C1512346;C1561542;C0018792;C3534109;C4331837;C0523744;C0013604;C0280097;C1995642;C3272565;C0886384;C0332155;C1512346;C0262499;C4699193;C1947943,C0039082;C0018792,20120201,,,Completed,29085669,0,0.0,0.030763219195115002,0.024303160422012,"Patient is a male or post menopausal female, 30-70 years of age on the day of signing             informed consent.

Non-obese      patients with type-2-diabetes are usually treated with insulin-secretagogues or insulin when      diet fails. Since non-obese patients with type-2-diabetes also carry a high risk of      cardiovascular events, the use of metformin for this sub-group of patients might be more      beneficial. Moreover, when insulin-treatment is initiated ongoing oral hypoglycaemic agents      (OHA) are often continued, but in non-obese patients with type-2 diabetes little evidence      exist for choosing the optimal class of OHA to be combined with insulin. The aim of the      project is therefore to investigate the effect of metformin vs. an insulin-secretagogue      (repaglinide) in combination with insulin on glycemic control and non-glycemic cardiovascular      risk-factors in non-obese patients with type-2-diabetes, uncontrolled on diet alone.

The same measurements will be carried out as at the beginning of the      study, with the exception of the polysomnographic study. Nonetheless, pulse oximetry and      arterial gases will be performed on waking.      Expected Results:      Patients with OHS may be characterized and differentiated from obese patients without      associated respiratory pathology on the basis of clinical, functional and metabolic data.      There is a group of patients with association between OSAHS and OHS that do not respond to      treatment with CPAP, and this unfavorable response can be predicted in advance.",Obesity Hypoventilation syndrome;cytokines;Adipokines;continuous positive airway pressure;bilevel support ventilation;Response to continuous positive airway pressure;,"Nervous System Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Respiratory Tract Diseases;Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases;",C3203358;C0087111;C0039082;C3272565;C1704632;C0028754;C0947630,C0199451;C0031880;C1997883;C0087111;C3272565;C1704632;C0947630,C0199451;C0745186;C0199470;C0521982;C0162701;C3203358;C0034108;C0441767;C0024115;C0441767;C0037315;C0004083;C0018017;C0024109;C0677042;C0087111;C0087111;C0677042;C0087111;C0235546;C0039082;C1704632;C0235546;C0332128;C1517001;C1704632;C0028754;C0028754;C0441861;C0699809;C0542560;C1552839;C0025344;C1552839;C0442696;C0028754;C0947630;C0947630;C0234422;C0028754;C0028754;C0947630;C1300072;C0028754;C0028754;C0028754;C0003578;C0918012;C1561542;C1552850;C0947630;C0947630;C0028754;C3245479;C3245479;C0042497;C0042497;C0182339;C1561593;C1964257;C0233492;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C0969625;C2825142;C4067746;C0562230;C1254545;C0022396;C0031843;C0031843;C2707259;C2707259;C3858576;C1561542;C1552839;C1328018;C1552839;C3203358;C3203358;C3203358;C3272565;C1334278;C3272565;C0182913;C0003842;C3272565,C3203358;C0039082;C0031880,C0027868;C0005893;C3203358;C1533734;C0034394;C0009488;C0205076;C0037981;C0012634;C0012634;C0028754;C0542560;C1547311;C0205082;C0391839;C1114365;C0933845;C0042497;C3272565,C0199451;C3203358;C1446409;C0028754;C0178987,20060601,,,Completed,23714281,5,5.0,0.024068202905608998,0.023317999795235,"Obesity degree I-III (Body mass index, BMI >30 Kg/m2);;;;;;;;;;Stable daytime PCO2 >45 mmHg.;;;;;;;;;;Age < 75 years;;;;;;;;;;Absence of other parenchymal, respiratory or neuromuscular diseases, diseases of the             chest wall which may occur concomitantly with hypoventilation.;;;;;;;;;;Absence of exclusion criteria.",Cognitive disorders that interfere with the administration of the clinical             questionnaires.;;;;;;;;;;Severe comorbidity.;;;;;;;;;;FEV1/FVC ratio < 65% in the forced spirometry.

Behavioral therapies for weight      loss are successful in some, but others need more aggressive approaches such as drug therapy.      In addition, up to 25% of severely obese children have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT),      which places them at significantly elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and      cardiovascular disease. Although various drug therapies for weight loss and IGT have been      explored in adults, few have been evaluated in children.      Recently, a new drug class has emerged that targets deficiencies of GLP-1. One of the main      glycemic mechanisms of action of the GLP-1 agonists such as exenatide is to enhance glucose      disposal in the postprandial setting and improve glucose tolerance. In addition, exenatide      can induce weight loss by decreasing appetite and slowing gastric motility.",Obesity;Impaired Glucose Tolerance;Children;,"Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases;",C1262477;C0013220;C0184511;C0087111;C0017725;C0028754,C1262477;C2911690;C0013220;C0184511;C0087111;C0017725;C0028754;C0947630;C3897779,C0271650;C0011860;C0007222;C0178665;C0013216;C0013216;C1262477;C1262477;C2986890;C0442797;C0087111;C0167117;C0167117;C0205082;C0205082;C0243192;C0003618;C0678835;C3540008;C0017725;C0542559;C0038351;C1305866;C3539125;C0028754;C0028754;C0456387;C0013227;C1578513;C0184511;C1547300;C0031327;C0220825;C0856882;C0180799;C0162538,C0944911;C0028756,C0017178;C0521654;C0751792;C0520863;C0373595;C1456587;C0011849;C1565489;C0005893;C0018801;C0013216;C0199230;C0549206;C0032074;C0549206;C0262926;C0028754;C4085651;C0205082;C1553386;C0205082;C1512346;C0023884;C1299581;C1114365;C1578513;C3842337;C4684637;C0589507;C4331837;C1995642;C1550518;C1879652;C1140618,C0017725,20110201,8.0,66.0,Completed,22076596,22,22.0,0.023389630014029997,0.022665307172848998,"Age 8-19 years old;;;;;;;;;;Subject able to give assent, and parent/guardian capable of giving consent on behalf             of the child;;;;;;;;;;Body mass index (BMI) ΓëÑ 99th percentile (based on gender and age)","Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus;;;;;;;;;;Initiation of a new drug therapy within the past 30 days prior to the screening visit;;;;;;;;;;BMI ΓëÑ 55;;;;;;;;;;History of weight loss surgery;;;;;;;;;;Obesity from a genetic cause (e.g., Prader-Willi);;;;;;;;;;Central nervous system injury or severe neurological impairment;;;;;;;;;;Known systolic or diastolic dysfunction or heart failure;;;;;;;;;;Females who are currently pregnant or planning to become pregnant;;;;;;;;;;Liver enzymes > 2.5 times upper limit of normal;;;;;;;;;;Severe renal impairment (defined as creatinine clearance <30 mL/min);;;;;;;;;;Gastrointestinal disease"
