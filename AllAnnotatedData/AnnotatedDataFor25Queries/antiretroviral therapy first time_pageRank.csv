Monitoring Laboratory. HIV infection as                  determined by an outside Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments                  (CLIA)-approved laboratory facility"" will be accepted for enrollment and verified                  by a standard HIV-1 ELISA with Western Blot at NIH.                  For Keny Medical Research Institute/Walter Reed Project Clinical Research Center                  (KEMRI/WRP CRC)/Kenya site: HIV-1 infection will initially be diagnosed based                  upon two, serial rapid HIV tests according to Kenya Ministry of Health (MOH)                  guidelines. Volunteers entering this study will have HIV infection confirmed by                  two serial rapid HIV test in accordance with Kenya MOH guidelines and testing                  algorithm followed by a confirmation with a Western Blot using FDA approved-kits.                  Samples from participants with discrepant results (between the results from other                  institution and KEMRI/WRP-CRC laboratory) and/or indeterminate/negative Western                  Blot will be subjected to a nucleic acid assay i.e. DNA or RNA PCR. For Thailand,                  HIV-1 screening and confirmatory testing will be based on 3, HIV tests according                  to the Thai Ministry of Public Health guidelines. The subjects will initially be                  tested with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) method that                  detects both HIV antigen and antibody. Confirmatory testing of HIV reactive                  samples by two different antibody detection methods will follow. Positive results                  by all three methods confirm HIV diagnosis. Discrepancy between the tests will                  require a nucleic acid detection method to confirm HIV diagnosis.               2. No previous treatment with potent combination anti-retroviral therapy (ART),                  defined as any protease inhibitor (PI)-based or non-nucleoside reverse                  transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen, or even triple nucleoside reverse                  transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)-based regimen, consisting of at least three                  antiretroviral drugs (including a boosted PI with NNRTI combination).

(For                  Thailand: storage of blood or tissue samples is an optional procedure and                  therefore not a inclusion criteria)               8. Be willing to have HLA testing. (For Thailand: HLA testing is an optional                  procedure and therefore not an inclusion criteria)               9. For the NIH/US site: Participants should have a primary care physician or will                  need to agree to find one during the first 24-48 weeks on study. For the                  KEMRI/WRP/Kenya site: Participants must be enrolled in the Kericho District                  Hospital HIV Clinic. For the two Thailand clinical sites: participants must be                  enrolled in the HIV clinic at either of the sites.        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:          1. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator,             would interfere with adherence to study requirements.          2. Pregnancy will be an exclusion criterion for study entry given the intense nature of             the protocol regarding blood draws, diagnostic testing, and follow-up.","This study will investigate what factors may lead to the development of immune reconstitution      syndrome (IRIS) in HIV-infected patients and what the outcome is after IRIS. It will also      seek to better define and describe the syndrome. IRIS is a condition that can occur in      HIV-infected people following the start of antiretroviral therapy. The sudden improvement of      immune function with this therapy can cause an unexpected worsening of diseases the patient      already has, such as tuberculosis or fungal infections, and development of fever, enlarged      lymph nodes or other complications, or even uncover a previously silent disease.      HIV-infected people who are at least 18 years old, whose CD4+T cell count is 100 cells per      microliter or less, and who have not previously been treated with combination antiretroviral      therapy or have taken the drugs for less than 3 months and more than 6 months before      screening for this study may be eligible to participate. Candindates must also live within      the wider DC area so that acute problems after therapy initiation will be evaluated at NIH.      Candidates are evaluated before starting therapy with a medical history and physical      examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, chest x-ray and CT scan of the chest,      tuberculin skin testing, apheresis, and possibly an intestinal (gut) and lymph node biopsy      (surgical removal of a small piece of tissue for microscopic examination). For apheresis,      blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and spun in a machine that separates the      blood components. The white blood cells and plasma are removed, and the red cells and      platelets are returned through the same needle or through a needle in a vein in the other      arm.      Participants have a complete history and physical examination and additional blood tests,      including genetic studies, upon entering the study. They start taking anti-HIV medications,      prescribed according to the current standard of care, as well as medications to treat other      infections, and treatment of IRIS, if needed. The study lasts about 4 years. Patients return      to the clinic at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the entry visit, then every 12 weeks (about every      3 months) until week 48 (the first year), and then every 16 weeks (about every 4 months)      until the end of the study. At most visits, patients have a medical history, physical      examination and blood and urine tests, including CD4+T cell count and HIV plasma viral load      measurement. Apheresis is also done at weeks 24 and 48 and then once every 48 weeks.      Intestinal and lymph node biopsies (optional) are also done at weeks 24 and 48. A syphilis      test and PAP smear (for women) are done yearly. and plasma, cells and serum are stored at      almost every visit for immunologic studies.",Opportunistic Infections;Immune Restoration Disease;Mycobacterial Infections;HIV-1 Infection;HIV;ART Naive;,"Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Immune System Diseases;",C1619738;C1963724;C0439663;C1550655,C1619738;C1963724;C1964257;C0243009;C0439663;C0947630;C1549782;C0007584;C0022077;C1550655,C0150618;C0026018;C1963724;C0026946;C0013798;C0193842;C0015252;C0085430;C2936643;C0262926;C0262926;C0009566;C0041296;C0037296;C0243107;C0243107;C0024204;C0031809;C1263430;C0039985;C0018941;C0013227;C0013227;C0031809;C1263430;C0007584;C0589507;C0041289;C0021853;C0278329;C3714514;C0007584;C0376705;C0021853;C0024204;C0012634;C0199230;C0005791;C0005791;C0087111;C0005791;C0039082;C0439663;C0039082;C0439663;C0031843;C0012634;C0439663;C0226792;C0005558;C0039128;C0087111;C0012634;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0040405;C0947630;C0947630;C0439662;C4684637;C0439662;C0027551;C0032105;C0027551;C0027551;C0032105;C0032105;C0947630;C1552850;C0015967;C0013227;C0947630;C0005767;C0817096;C0005767;C0005767;C0947630;C1552850;C0947630;C1512346;C0947630;C0005767;C0444186;C0229671;C1512346;C1442948;C0022077;C0022077;C0022077;C0042449;C0022077;C1561540;C1561543;C0392366;C0699819;C0446516;C3539181;C0935444;C0033213;C1550655;C4055646;C0311392;C3844714;C0202165;C0220825;C0220825;C0086972;C0032181;C3843399;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1512346;C0523113;C3843322;C1521740;C4699275;C1293134;C0332149;C4283785;C0031809;C3843408;C0332155,C0039082;C1334180;C4525117,C0014441;C0872232;C0430425;C0033607;C0086143;C0019693;C0019693;C0920550;C0920550;C0190979;C0005863;C0005863;C1611825;C0005863;C0750484;C0750484;C0033137;C0370231;C0370231;C0020980;C3241999;C0190979;C1301725;C0022885;C0150369;C0022885;C0022885;C1516879;C0162791;C0162791;C0162791;C0007584;C0162340;C0439857;C0009450;C0199230;C0919386;C0009450;C0011900;C0459958;C0750484;C0002045;C0199230;C0459958;C0087111;C0199230;C0220908;C0199230;C0199230;C0184661;C0184661;C0032961;C3272565;C3272565;C2828392;C3272565;C0459958;C0205160;C0003241;C1446409;C4684790;C4684790;C0442711;C0199168;C0392366;C0392366;C0392366;C0025663;C0025663;C0750484;C0750484;C0087111;C0040808;C0040808;C0600109;C0600109;C0392366;C0392366;C0001962;C3810851;C0031082;C0031082;C1552597;C0392366;C0025663;C0025663;C0034627;C0034627;C0034627;C0718247;C0947630;C1510438;C0392366;C0013227;C0947630;C0947630;C0005767;C0005767;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C3244317;C0392366;C1316572;C0013227;C3539181;C3539181;C0680532;C0935444;C1550655;C3245501;C0009797;C1546848;C1290905;C4082977;C4082977;C0442726;C4684637;C1328956;C1328956;C1328956;C1328956;C0022885;C0022885;C0022885;C3840630;C3840630;C0282519;C0282519;C0699576;C0804815;C0332534;C4331837;C0973449;C1254223;C4284141;C4284141;C4699275;C4699275;C3272565;C3272565;C0016538;C0599990;C1290905;C0474588;C0474588;C4698129,C0449982;C0029118,20181101,,,Completed,22219223;20660788,103,51.5,0.032688295089578,0.032182708033516,"For the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/US site: HIV-1 infection, as                  documented by OraQuick rapid test using venipuncture whole blood, or fingerstick                  whole blood done at screening; or by reactive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay                  (ELISA) and Western Blot as determined by NIH Clinical Pathology Laboratory or                  Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc.

For subjects who receive only 2 ART, at        least one of these two medications should be a protease inhibitor (PI). Subjects are not        eligible if ART is discontinued for a cumulative period of 7 or more days during the 4        months prior to randomization.        Subjects with documented HIV-1 infection. Acceptable documentation consists of either of        the following:        Positive HIV-1 ELISA test and Western Blot;        Detectable plasma viral load measurement (greater than 500 RNA copies/mL using an        ultrasensitive bDNA or PCR test or greater than 1500 RNA copies/mL using a        non-ultrasensitive bDNA or PCR test).        CD4+ T cell counts: mean of 2 points obtained within 4 calendar months of randomization        greater than or equal to 50 and less than 300 cells/mm(3). The first CD4+ count should be        the most recent documented historical value and should be greater than or equal to 50 and        less than 300 cells/mm(3); the second point should be pre-study visit 1.        Viral load less than 10,000 copies/mL, at 2 time points within 4 calendar months of        randomization. The first viral load should be the most recent documented historical value        and should be less than 10,000 copies/mL; the second time point should be pre-study visit        1.        Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 80%.        Age greater than or equal to 18 years old.        Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within        28 days prior to randomization. They must also understand that if they are randomized to        the IL-2 group, they must practice effective contraception during their first 2 years of        study participation. Pregnancy is discouraged among IL-2 recipients, but if an IL-2        recipient wishes to become pregnant after two years of trial participation she must alert        the investigator prior to interruption of contraception. The potential for risk to the        fetus must be carefully discussed with the subject before contraception is interrupted.        Effective contraception will be continued for at least 24 hours following the interruption        of IL-2 therapy. IL-2 will be held throughout the period of time during which the subject        is not practicing effective birth control, throughout the pregnancy, and throughout any        period of breast feeding. If oral contraceptive therapy is resumed after a period of        interruption, IL-2 dosing will be delayed for 1 month following the reinstatement of oral        contraceptive therapy. The subject must have a negative pregnancy test result prior to        dosing with IL-2 after a lapse in effective contraception.        The following laboratory criteria must be fulfilled within 28 days of enrollment in the        study:        Serum AST of less than or equal to 5 times upper limit of normal range (ULN);        Serum bilirubin less than or equal 2 times ULN (patients with Gilbert's syndrome or        protease inhibitor-induced hyperbilirubinemia must have a serum bilirubin less than or        equal to five times ULN);        Amylase less than 2.0 times ULN (hyperamylasemia that is determined to be non-pancreatic in        origin does not necessarily constitute an exclusion to enrollment);        Less than 2 + proteinuria;        Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN;        Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1000 cells/mm(3);        Hemoglobin of greater than or equal to 9.5 g/dL;        Platelet count of greater than or equal to 75,000/mm(3);        Negative HTLV-1 result.

CD4+ T cells are a subset of lymphocytes-white blood cells that are part of the      body's immune system. IL-2 is a protein that is naturally produced by lymphocytes. Given in      intermittent cycles, IL-2 can raise CD4+ T cell counts in some HIV-infected patients taking      antiretroviral drugs. This study will examine whether the increase in CD4+ T cells lowers the      risk of AIDS-related illnesses and death.      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with a viral load under 10,000 copies per      milliliter and a CD4+ T cell count between 50 and 299 cells per cubic millimeter who are      taking antiretroviral therapy and who have not previously received IL-2 therapy may be      eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical      examination, and blood and urine tests. Participation in the study will be from 4.5 to 6      years, depending on what point in the duration of the study the individual patient is      enrolled.      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive IL-2 plus ART or ART alone. All participants      will be advised individually about the best ART regimen for them. Patients in the IL-2      treatment group will be taught how to self-inject IL-2 under the skin (similar to insulin      injections). They will inject IL-2 twice a day for 5 days every 8 weeks for the first year      (until week 49 of the study). From week 49 on they may receive 5-day cycles of IL-2 every 4      months when needed to maintain CD4+ T cell count elevations. An extra cycle may be given 2      months after the week 49 follow-up visit (see follow-up schedule below), depending on their      CD4+ T cell count. Patients whose cell counts have not increased after 12 to 16 months of      IL-2 treatment will discuss with the doctor the possibility of stopping IL-2. Those who do      stop IL-2 treatment will be asked to remain in the study for follow-up evaluations.      All patients will be followed in the clinic every 2 months for the first year of the study      (weeks 1, 9, 17, 25, 33, 41 and 49) and every 4 months during years 2-6 for a brief history      and physical exam, urine and blood tests, return of diary cards (record of drug side effects)      and medication review. During the visits from the second year on, patients will also be asked      about their ability to do certain ordinary tasks, such as taking care of themselves; ...",HIV;Proleukin;IL-2;Adult;HAART;Treatment Experienced;,Virus Diseases;Immune System Diseases;,C1963724;C1522405;C0243009;C0439663;C0947630;C4321351;C1550655,C1963724;C1522405;C0243009;C1548762;C0680532;C3272565;C0439663;C0718247;C0947630;C4321351;C1550655;C0169964;C3897779;C3842127,C1963724;C1963724;C0242656;C0041755;C0560023;C0262926;C0589121;C1522405;C0031809;C0007584;C0007584;C0031809;C1263430;C0007584;C0220825;C0018941;C0376705;C0007584;C0021485;C0007584;C0007584;C0221423;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0439663;C0439663;C4684790;C1552601;C0086960;C0723457;C0087111;C0040808;C0021641;C0262512;C0439662;C0034869;C0947630;C0439044;C0005767;C0013227;C0947630;C0011065;C0947630;C0005767;C0947630;C0947630;C0439044;C0947630;C3244317;C0947630;C0947630;C0042036;C0376660;C1551994;C1561543;C1561540;C1561540;C1561540;C1561543;C1561543;C1550472;C1561538;C0042789;C2698833;C2698833;C0439775;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C0000589;C0000589;C0233492;C3540799;C0745348;C0332534;C4699604;C3843399;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1512346;C0655359;C1555709;C1552839;C1101725;C0056685;C1553756;C4086490;C0031809;C0033621;C0087130;C0151576,C0019693,C1535939;C4317078;C0021390;C0948762;C1334177;C0018802;C0427780;C0005957;C0239295;C0151744;C0149783;C0152486;C0152486;C1883256;C0430064;C0694550;C0030499;C0033607;C1518965;C0009905;C0017551;C0033607;C0020433;C0027627;C0677874;C0043094;C0010418;C0011849;C0002845;C0036220;C0006625;C0014544;C0428441;C0221773;C0262926;C0302592;C0262926;C0040732;C0003376;C0275518;C0006147;C0677874;C1550661;C1113679;C0029134;C0020676;C1113679;C0014822;C0175636;C0700589;C0700589;C0700589;C0700589;C0700589;C0009871;C0700589;C0920316;C0920316;C0040558;C0005863;C0392920;C0031809;C0392920;C0041296;C0311386;C1555471;C0013227;C0007584;C0033687;C0006840;C1301725;C1548428;C0020402;C1301725;C3830527;C0376705;C1301725;C0376705;C1301725;C0162340;C1516879;C0030274;C1516879;C0518015;C0003308;C1301725;C1516879;C0021853;C0021853;C1704788;C0684336;C0740166;C0684275;C0006826;C0009450;C0206065;C0032961;C0032961;C0221423;C0012634;C0544452;C0014245;C0032285;C0024109;C0012634;C0033860;C0023890;C0199230;C1446409;C0205160;C0237607;C0549206;C0205160;C0024299;C0024299;C0024299;C0205161;C1446409;C0024299;C0205160;C0024299;C0205160;C1334278;C0205161;C0205161;C1552740;C0012634;C0549206;C0442711;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C4035627;C0002712;C0262512;C0262512;C0012634;C0947630;C0262512;C0087111;C0262512;C0221198;C0262512;C0012634;C0079595;C0947630;C0087111;C0012634;C0079595;C0947630;C0012634;C0040405;C0012634;C1547296;C0012634;C0087111;C0262512;C0018787;C0040132;C0012634;C0009818;C0030695;C0221423;C0001962;C0087111;C0025344;C0025344;C0032105;C0025344;C0025344;C0025344;C1553386;C1550512;C0376152;C0376152;C0034869;C0006826;C1553386;C0034869;C1553386;C0022646;C0001721;C0205082;C1553386;C0001721;C0947630;C0947630;C1512346;C0947630;C1512346;C0042036;C0947630;C0239110;C1561542;C0947630;C0229671;C0229671;C0229671;C3641827;C0947630;C0006104;C0006104;C0006104;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C0392366;C0392366;C0392366;C0262950;C0262950;C1706255;C0013227;C1114365;C0001551;C0304497;C0338656;C0015502;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C4699604;C4699604;C4699604;C4699604;C4699604;C4699604;C4699604;C4699604;C4699604;C4699604;C4699604;C4699604;C4699604;C4699604;C0020843;C0032181;C3843195;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1457887;C1550655;C1550655;C0042779;C1552867;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C1552867;C4699613;C0424530;C0424530;C0009797;C1444662;C0033085;C1306645;C4082977;C3827727;C4684637;C1518681;C1320102;C1320102;C1320102;C1552658;C0376705;C1552658;C0022885;C0201975;C1514893;C1514893;C3714738;C0443146;C3714738;C3714738;C4048188;C0025953;C0202165;C3844714;C3844714;C0201913;C1382187;C2828358;C3843399;C0449900;C0332534;C3843399;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1706074;C1706074;C1706074;C1706074;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C1552839;C0018792;C4331837;C4331837;C2702329;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C4331837;C0018792;C0018792;C0018792;C3843322;C4697669;C4699275;C4699275;C4086490;C1555587;C3272565;C4283785;C1514893;C3272565;C3272565;C1514893;C1514893;C1547226;C1548573;C4035633;C0332155;C3842265;C0332155;C3842265;C1140618;C0084688;C1444662,C0596545,20070101,1086.0,211875.0,Completed,24870935;19828532,196,98.0,0.029833081596314,0.030663783117979997,"Viral load less than 10,000 copies/mL, at 2 time points within 4 calendar months of        randomization.

Data suggest that aggressive management of HIV infection, which includes      Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) during treatment of TB, decreases both morbidity and      mortality. On the other hand, the use of HAART for patients with TB may cause severe      complications due to drug-drug interactions, and occasionally a temporary exacerbation of      symptoms. These reactions may be particularly severe when HAART is started soon after the      start of TB treatment.

Members of the SANDF with HIV infection may be eligible for this study. HIV-infected family      members who are 14 years of age and older may also participate. All participants must have a      CD4 count of less than 200 or an AIDS-defining illness.      Participants are randomly assigned to one of the following four antiretroviral drug regimens,      which require taking 5 pills or more every day:        -  AZT (zidovudine) + ddl (didanosine) + EFV (efavirenz)        -  AZT (zidovudine) + ddl (didanosine) + r/LPV (lopinavir/ritonavir)        -  D4T (stavudine) + 3TC (lamivudine) + EFV (efavirenz)        -  D4T (stavudine) + 3TC (lamivudine) + r/LPV (lopinavir/ritonavir)      Patients are followed for up to 6 years. Clinic visits are scheduled once a month for the      first 3 months and then once every 3 months for the next five years. Patients undergo a      medical history, physical examination, and blood tests at each visit, and complete      questionnaires of behavior, quality of life, and force readiness every year.",Protease Inhibitors;Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors;AIDS;Opportunistic Infections;Resource-Poor;,Virus Diseases;Immune System Diseases;,C1963724;C0012634;C0725066,C1963724;C0243009;C3811910;C0087111;C0012634;C1522485;C0947630;C0007584;C0040808;C1550655;C0725066;C3897779,C0031809;C0939237;C0939237;C0262926;C0518214;C0013216;C0018747;C0034394;C0019693;C0019693;C0018941;C0043474;C0012133;C0043474;C0012133;C0209738;C0209738;C1561565;C0674428;C0164662;C0674428;C0164662;C1318963;C3245457;C0439663;C1552601;C2945654;C0221423;C1301584;C0947630;C0947630;C1561542;C1512346;C1552861;C0013227;C1561543;C1561538;C0043474;C0043474;C0164662;C0209738;C0164662;C0209738;C0086960;C0677505;C1550655;C1550655;C3245501;C0242781;C1328956;C1512346;C1561542;C1561542;C0018792;C0016533;C1555709;C0016533;C0020796;C0376691;C3245457;C4283785;C0016538;C0034770;C4082977,C0021051;C0851162;C3245488,C0948762;C0041327;C0740830;C0018747;C0019693;C0019699;C0392920;C0030305;C0030305;C0041296;C0037995;C0199176;C1301725;C0007584;C0007584;C0007584;C0022885;C0010210;C0013227;C0035608;C0035608;C0011900;C0750484;C0087111;C0087111;C0677042;C0087111;C0199230;C0857127;C0199230;C0032961;C0274281;C0274281;C0439663;C0150600;C0442711;C0679006;C0332149;C0011209;C4684790;C1261473;C0262512;C0087111;C0040808;C1301584;C0449416;C1553386;C0557034;C0229671;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C0947630;C0013227;C0013227;C1550557;C0919834;C0184661;C1550470;C0032181;C0935444;C4699158;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C0009797;C4284141;C1514821;C1261322;C3839460;C0077935;C1512346;C1555709;C1522411;C0020796;C0020796;C0020796;C2349988;C4699275;C3245501;C3272565;C1555587;C0034770;C3843408;C0332155;C4035633;C0233697;C0518015;C1140618;C4698129,C0030946;C1547310;C0282519,20080801,648.0,23023.0,Completed,22448211;21716078;20942650,67,22.3333333333333,0.023122797367932997,0.026053083100525003,"Haemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0g/dL for men and greater than or equal to             8.0g/dL for women.;;;;;;;;;;Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 500 cells/microL.;;;;;;;;;;Platelet count greater than or equal to 25,000/mm(3).;;;;;;;;;;Serum transaminase (ALT or AST) less than or equal to 5 times upper limit of normal             (ULN).             14 years or older.

The molecular,      cellular, and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the HIV-associated immune activation      are complex and still poorly studied. There is, however, growing consensus that both viral      and host factors contribute to this phenotype, with emphasis on the role played by the      mucosal immune dysfunction (and consequent microbial translocation). Moreover if it is known      that in HIV-infected individuals, a severe depletion of intestinal cluster of differentiation      4 (CD4+) T-cells, is associated with loss of epithelium integrity, microbial translocation      and systemic immune activation, the kinetics of intestinal CD4+ T-cell reconstitution under      combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) remains poorly understood.      This study sought to evaluate the reconstitution of intestinal CD4+ T-cells, including Th1      and Th17, in blood and colon samples collected from HIV-infected individuals before and after      a short term cART.",HIV infection;GUT;microbial translocation;chronic inflammation;antiretroviral therapy;cART;HAART;Th17;Th1;CD4+;,Virus Diseases;Bacterial Infections and Mycoses;Immune System Diseases;,C1963724;C0021853;C2004454;C0439663;C0947630;C0007584,C1963724;C0019693;C0021853;C1705273;C0439663;C0439662;C0007584;C0021853;C1561514,C1963724;C1511938;C0019693;C0242656;C0277785;C0021853;C0021853;C0021853;C1285572;C0178539;C0439663;C0439663;C0947630;C0439662;C0439662;C0600138;C0439662;C0205082;C0439662;C0947630;C0005767;C0009368;C1704326;C4067746;C3845876;C0162340;C1328018;C1512793;C0220825;C0939261;C0277785,C0021051,C0021851;C0742766;C0003280;C0009378;C0162791;C0013227;C0006826;C0190979;C0087111;C0087111;C0032961;C0012634;C0262512;C0439662;C0002871;C1552850;C1561542;C1301624;C0442743;C0562357;C0001617,,20141201,,,Unknown status,25340778,13,13.0,0.025707828553567003,0.022999404379383,na├»ve for antiretroviral treatment;;;;;;;;;;met the criteria to start cART according to International Guidelines;;;;;;;;;;written informed consent signed,"treatment with glucocorticosteroids and any immune modulating medication for more than             seven days in the previous month;;;;;;;;;;any past or current systemic malignancy, history of inflammatory diseases of the small             or large intestine;;;;;;;;;;pregnancy;;;;;;;;;;anemia, use of anticoagulants, and any contraindications to phlebotomy or colonoscopy."

This is known as      post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).      Although there are different recommendations, almost every guideline recommend using 3 drugs      as PEP both in USA and Europe.

But      it was shown in the setting of HIV-related PML, that combination antiretroviral therapy      allows a restoration of the immune system and then might stop the progression of PML.      The objective of this study is to appreciate the supplementary efficiency brought by an      association of more powerful antiretroviral molecules including enfuvirtide on the evolution      of PML. This research program will involve 30 patients in several centres in France. All the      patients who will participate will receive enfuvirtide during 6 months in association with a      combination of two or more potent antiretroviral drugs.

Secondary hypotheses are that recovery of pathogen specific cellular immunity directed at C.      neoformans, as manifested by increases in the number and function of C. neoformans-specific      peripheral blood mononuclear cells is associated with 1) ART and 2) pathogen clearance.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ), also known as bactrim, is a common antibiotic and      used as prophylaxis for OIs. For countries with high prevalence of HIV and limited health      infrastructure, the WHO endorses universal TMP/SMZ for all HIV-infected individuals. Notably,      these guidelines were created prior to the scale-up of ARTs. Following ART and subsequent      immune recovery, TMP/SMZ may no longer be required. In the US and Europe, for example,      TMP/SMZ is discontinued after patients show evidence of immune recovery. Therefore, we      propose a prospective randomized trial among HIV infected individuals on ART with evidence of      immune recovery (ART for > 18mo and CD4 >350 cells/mm3) to determine whether continued      TMP/SMZ prophylaxis confers benefits in decreasing morbidity (malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea),      mortality, CD4 count maintenance, ART treatment failure and malaria immune responses.",HIV;Co-Infections;Malaria;Pneumonia;Diarrhea;,"Respiratory Tract Diseases;Immune System Diseases;Parasitic Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Virus Diseases;Bacterial Infections and Mycoses;",C1963724;C0038689;C1444662;C0041041;C0199176,C1963724;C0038689;C1444662;C0041041;C0199176;C3897779,C0029118;C1963724;C0162643;C0038689;C0041041;C0199176;C0199176;C0199176;C0003232;C0162791;C0442797;C0442797;C4316796;C0220880;C0032285;C1561565;C0439663;C0439663;C3245501;C0439663;C0011991;C0591139;C0024530;C0024530;C3245511;C0439662;C0439662;C0439662;C0439662;C0175659;C1273517;C0029118;C0029118;C1704632;C2004454;C2004454;C2004454;C1444662;C4699274;C4331837;C0018792;C3834249;C4082977;C1444662,C0021051;C0012634;C0009450;C0008533,C0162643;C0006147;C1516879;C1516879;C0162791;C1561565;C0549206;C0600109;C0600109;C0392366;C0087111;C0042036;C1299581;C0589121;C0086960;C0009797;C4684637;C4699274;C1561542,,20131001,,,Completed,30897090;28077587;26731191,8,2.6666666666666696,0.018082493331836005,0.017501870505318002,Participants must be at least 18 years of age.;;;;;;;;;;Participants must be willing to participate and give written informed consent.;;;;;;;;;;Participants must be willing and able to return for the scheduled follow-up visits.;;;;;;;;;;Participants must have been on ART for > 18 months.;;;;;;;;;;Participants must have a CD4 count of > 350 cells/mm;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Participants must not be suspected of ART treatment failure.,Participants must not be pregnant at enrollment (by urine HCG testing).;;;;;;;;;;Participants must not be breastfeeding at the time of enrollment.;;;;;;;;;;Participants must be on first-line ART therapy as defined by Kenyan National             Guidelines.
