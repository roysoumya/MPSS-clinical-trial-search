A high prevalence of epilepsy has been noted      particularly in onchocerciasis hyperendemic areas where onchocerciasis is not or      insufficiently controlled with mass Ivermectin distribution. There is evidence that      increasing the coverage of Ivermectin reduces the incidence of epilepsy and anecdotal      evidence suggests a reduction in seizure frequency in onchocerciasis associated epilepsy      (OAE) patients who receive Ivermectin. Finding an alternative treatment for epilepsy in these      patients will have major consequences.      Objective      To assess whether Ivermectin treatment decreases the frequency of seizures and leads to      seizure freedom in OAE patients, including patients with NS. If we are able to demonstrate      such an effect this would be an extra argument that Onchocerciasis is causing epilepsy and      that therefore we should increase our efforts to eliminate onchocerciasis.      Methods      We will conduct a randomized clinical trial in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to      compare seizure freedom in onchocerciasis infested epilepsy patients who receive immediate      Ivermectin treatment with delayed (after four months) Ivermectin treatment. All participants      will simultaneously receive anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) according to local guidelines for      epilepsy treatment. The primary endpoint is seizure freedom defined as no seizures during the      fourth month of follow-up. Secondary endpoint is significant (>50%) seizure reduction      compared to baseline seizure frequency. Reduction of seizures will be compared between      Ivermectin and non-Ivermectin arms.      Current status      Start of enrolment is planned from March 2017 and we expect to have enrolled all 110      participants by August 2017. Results are expected early 2018.      Discussion      If Ivermectin treatment, in addition to AEDs, is able to lead to seizure freedom or      significantly reduces seizure frequency in OAE patients this will have major consequences for      epilepsy treatment in Onchocerciasis endemic regions. Ivermectin is donated for free, and in      non Loa-Loa endemic regions has negligible side effects. Reducing the burden of epilepsy will      have a major impact on quality of life and socio-economic status of families with affected      members in Africa.",,Parasitic Diseases;Nervous System Diseases;Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases;,C0029001;C0022322;C0087111;C0014544;C1550655,C0206034;C0029001;C0022322;C0087111;C0014544;C1550655,C0206034;C0149775;C0149775;C0149775;C3658353;C2986535;C0029002;C0518214;C0029001;C0029001;C0029001;C0029001;C0029001;C0029001;C0029001;C0029001;C0877248;C0004083;C0022322;C0022322;C0022322;C0022322;C0022322;C0022322;C0162791;C0022322;C0022322;C0022322;C0022322;C4551656;C0087111;C0018017;C0087111;C1697779;C0087111;C0087111;C0014544;C0087111;C4551656;C1293152;C0087111;C0087111;C0700287;C0014544;C0014544;C3854012;C0014544;C0014544;C0014544;C0036572;C0014544;C0014544;C0014544;C0036572;C0036572;C4684790;C0014544;C0014544;C0947630;C0037088;C0036572;C0025663;C0036572;C0036572;C0036572;C0036572;C1518681;C0013227;C1561542;C0577559;C1299581;C0446516;C1299581;C1442948;C1378698;C0015264;C4684637;C2825142;C2911690;C0557061;C3166194;C0442797;C2347273;C0027627;C4055646;C1561542;C1328018;C1101725;C0221106;C0204742;C0728774;C4698437;C0034770,,C0009797;C0559477;C0024534;C0006147;C0014038;C0243107;C0018674;C0003241;C0022322;C0022322;C0025289;C0032961;C0014544;C0014544;C0036572;C0150312;C0014544;C0036572;C0020517;C0262512;C1519316;C0231683;C0205082;C1561542;C0005767;C1114365;C2707261;C3890370;C3890370;C2347273;C1561542;C3842265,C1140111,20180801,,,Completed,28855148,3,3,0.102913957197505,0.1060489920049,Age 5 years and above;;;;;;;;;;Signed informed consent form;;;;;;;;;;Normal neurological development until onset of epilepsy;;;;;;;;;;Onset of epilepsy between ages of 5 and 18 years;;;;;;;;;;Seizure frequency of ΓëÑ2 seizures per month;;;;;;;;;;Presence of microfilaria in skin snip and/or antibodies against Ov16,"Pregnancy or breastfeeding;;;;;;;;;;Known or suspected allergy to Ivermectin;;;;;;;;;;Loa Loa microfilariae in blood;;;;;;;;;;Epilepsy with known cause (e.g. severe head trauma, perinatal asphyxia, patients with             a history of cerebral malaria, meningitis or encephalitis)"

Methylphenidate (MPH) is also helpful in treating attention and other cognitive difficulties      in a variety of other neurological and medical conditions (Kajs-Wyllie, 2002; Prommer, 2012).      We seek to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of this medication in treating      attention deficits, as well as other cognitive difficulties, experienced by adult patients      with epilepsy.      To our knowledge, there are currently very few studies which explicitly examine the impact of      MPH on measureable attention deficits and other cognitive deficits in adult patients with      epilepsy. We hope to quantify what impact, if any, methylphenidate has on attention, in      addition to other specific measureable cognitive functions, in patients with cognitive      complaints and epilepsy, and contribute to a growing body of evidence which supports the      safety of methylphenidate's use for attention deficits in patients with epilepsy. As other      effective treatments for attention and other cognitive difficulties in patients with epilepsy      are not currently available, MPH could represent an important option in the treatment of such      patients.",,Nervous System Diseases;,C0025810;C0087111;C0004268;C0014544,C0025810;C0087111;C0014544;C0004268,C0392335;C0009241;C0025810;C0025810;C0025810;C0025810;C1299586;C1299586;C1299586;C1299586;C0013227;C0277786;C0087111;C0004268;C0004268;C0004268;C0376554;C0004268;C0004268;C0004268;C0004268;C0087111;C0014544;C0014544;C0014544;C1552740;C0014544;C0014544;C0014544;C0947630;C1273517;C0392347;C0237607;C0012634;C0184511;C0000589;C2707261;C4084912;C3843395;C0150312;C0220825,C0277785;C0012634,C3554639;C3714756;C0027765;C0027765;C0038586;C0018793;C0003299;C0038220;C0033975;C0559546;C0038663;C0025810;C0262926;C0018799;C0740858;C0241028;C0025810;C0025810;C3841442;C0022658;C0237123;C0036341;C0006147;C0009871;C0020538;C0524850;C0013227;C0003811;C0039231;C0013227;C2979880;C0277786;C1516879;C0277786;C0013227;C3714514;C0013227;C0022423;C0087111;C0009240;C0221423;C0009240;C0085631;C0032961;C0036572;C0036572;C0036572;C0036572;C0017601;C0679199;C3245501;C3245501;C0262512;C0262512;C0392366;C0262926;C0018787;C0003467;C0262512;C0001962;C0001962;C0392366;C0262512;C0262926;C0262926;C0003537;C0600109;C1547311;C1553386;C0205082;C0205082;C0566415;C0718247;C0718247;C0566415;C0947630;C0947630;C1551040;C0947630;C1546725;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0023884;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0392366;C0947630;C1561543;C1561543;C1561543;C1299581;C1114365;C0025646;C0237123;C1457887;C2707261;C1704258;C1548428;C3166387;C1320102;C1320102;C0442739;C0804815;C4055646;C0856882;C4055646;C4055646;C1561542;C1512346;C4331837;C4331837;C0021141;C0030695;C4283785;C4699193,C1140111,20151201,14.0,480.0,Completed,28031390,5,5,0.108468703199577,0.096922754744092,For participants with seizures:;;;;;;;;;;H/o seizures of any cause;;;;;;;;;;Subjective cognitive complaints;;;;;;;;;;Stable antiepileptic drug doses which are not expected to change during the study;;;;;;;;;;Recent normal cardiac auscultation (may be done prior to enrollment by personal                  physician or study staff);;;;;;;;;;Neurologist's judgement that participant is clinically appropriate for this study;;;;;;;;;;For healthy volunteers;;;;;;;;;;No history of seizures or other neurological disorders;;;;;;;;;;No history of cognitive complaints for any reason (including ADHD);;;;;;;;;;Not on any medications which would interfere w/ cognitive testing;;;;;;;;;;English fluency,"History of an adverse reaction to methylphenidate;;;;;;;;;;Age >65 or <18;;;;;;;;;;Personal medical history of;;;;;;;;;;Arrhythmias,;;;;;;;;;;Structural cardiac disease,;;;;;;;;;;Other cardiac abnormality;;;;;;;;;;Uncontrolled hypertension (>150/95) during study.
