Currently, the Pilates      method has shown to be effective in improving pain and disability in patients with chronic      low back pain (CLBP). However, there is still no evidence about the ideal number of sessions      for the treatment and the interval between sessions to achieve better efficacy of this method      for these patients. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the      Pilates method with different weekly frequency of sessions in the treatment of patients with      nonspecific CLBP. Investigators will assess 296 patients of both genders, with nonspecific      CLBP lasting more than three months and aged between 18 and 80 years. Participants will be      randomly divided into four groups (n = 74 patients per group): Control Group will receive an      educational booklet and no additional exercise, Pilates 1 Group will receive a program of      exercises based on Pilates method once a week for six weeks, Pilates 2 Group will receive the      same program of exercises twice a week for six weeks and Pilates 3 Group will receive the      same program of exercises three times a week for six weeks.

At present patients with LBP start treatment as soon as possible, this also      applies for patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) - pain lasting over 12 weeks. At      Glostrup University Hospital department of Physical Medicine/rheumatology we use a method      (method A) where an interdisciplinary team gives the patients a treatment composed of various      topics. This includes among other things education, physical team training, exercises in      swimming pool, stretching exercises, and occupational therapy. A different method (method B)      originates from the Rehabilitation centre in Karlslunde led by Teddy Oefeldt. Here they focus      strictly on dynamic training of muscles in the back and the buttocks. A therapist, who in the      beginning partly carries the patient through the exercises, assists this training.      In both methods, individually considerations are taken, but to a greater extend in method B.      The treatment will extend over a three months period.      A few earlier investigations have compared these two methods, but they have not been      systematized to such a degree, that they gave any final conclusions. Therefore, we      initialized an investigation including a larger number of patients, where the two methods are      compared from the results the patients achieve after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.      286 consecutive patients were included and randomized to one of the two methods. Those, who      did not wish to participate in the investigation, were treated according to the department’s      normal procedure (Method A)",Low Back Pain;Dynamic Back-Muscle exercise Treatment;Interdisciplinary Treatment;Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire;SF-36;Low Back Pain Rating Scale;,"Nervous System Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0024031;C0087111;C1522704;C1547296;C0004600,C1140111,C0457949;C0600080;C1318464;C0034991;C0034991;C0518609;C0024031;C1552578;C1552578;C0087111;C0087111;C0424927;C0452240;C0452240;C0087111;C0184661;C0184511;C0332149;C0031809;C0013227;C0006497;C0150312;C3540008;C0699809;C0025663;C0025663;C0025663;C0025663;C0025663;C0025663;C0025663;C0025663;C0025663;C0025344;C0542560;C1553386;C0025663;C1552850;C0030193;C0004600;C1552578;C2360800;C0442694;C0442694;C0442694;C3843676;C0557034;C1170317;C1170317;C1555712;C1561542;C1561542;C0031809;C3242287;C0332155,C0004604;C0004600,C0080179;C0000739;C2707291;C0234254;C0004936;C0024031;C0006147;C0029456;C0024091;C2707261;C0277785;C0006826;C0851162;C0677042;C0543467;C0032961;C1261287;C0443343;C0817096;C0138547;C0476254;C1551395;C2827486;C0004600;C0004600;C1114365;C0442694;C0683278;C3843502;C0606665;C0033213;C0038016,C0231170;C0004604;C4083049;C0175659;C0004600;C0004600;C4321351;C0452240,20051101,,,Unknown status,20147878,8,8.0,0.044638022854878,0.036480633855348,Low Back Pain lasting more than 12 weeks with or with out pain radiating into the             leg(s);;;;;;;;;;Age 18 - 60 years,"Serious spinal pathology;;;;;;;;;;Malignancy;;;;;;;;;;Osteoporosis,;;;;;;;;;;Fresh vertebral fracture;;;;;;;;;;Newly operation on the back;;;;;;;;;;Stenosis of the lumbar spine;;;;;;;;;;Unstable spondylolistesis;;;;;;;;;;Infections in the back;;;;;;;;;;Neurological dysfunction of the thoracic or abdominal muscles;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy/breastfeeding;;;;;;;;;;Mental illness;;;;;;;;;;Health conditions which prohibit intensive training.;;;;;;;;;;Languish problems/ dyslexia"

Current treatments for low back pain in the emergency department      generally include pills or injections of medications to treat pain and relax muscles.      However, it is known that many of these medications have risks and toxicities which may limit      their safe use in some patients. Therefore, new types of treatments are needed.      Acupuncture is an ancient form of healing that has been practiced in some form for centuries.      In modern times, acupuncture has been studied for the long-term treatment of low back pain      and some research suggests it may be effective. However, very little research has examined      the use of acupuncture for immediate pain relief in the emergency department.      This research will study a type of acupuncture called Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA).      Battlefield acupuncture was designed by a physician in the US military with the purpose of      providing immediate pain relief. It involves the placement of 5 small needles in each ear.      The needles may be removed at any time. The hypothesis of this study is that battlefield      acupuncture may improve mobility and pain of patients with low back pain in the emergency      department.","Low back pain;Acupuncture therapy;Acupuncture, ear;","Nervous System Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C4321302;C0024031;C0087111;C1546844,C4321302;C0024031;C0087111;C1546844,C4321302;C0023977;C0024031;C0024031;C0024031;C0024031;C0394664;C0013227;C0013227;C0394664;C0394664;C0394664;C0451615;C0394664;C0394664;C0451615;C0394664;C0087111;C0021485;C0600688;C0087111;C0087111;C1546399;C1546399;C0719214;C1697779;C1546399;C1697779;C0441587;C1546399;C0332128;C3245457;C0425245;C0043240;C0027551;C0027551;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0030193;C0030193;C1578513;C0013443;C0237607;C0184511;C3844126;C0804815;C0699530,C0004604;C0004600,C0521654;C0032976;C0277786;C0542565;C0024031;C0741419;C0017313;C0042014;C0042014;C1546399;C0004604;C0032961;C0032961;C0012621;C3714552;C0699129;C1446409;C3263723;C0633084;C0021853;C1578513;C1578513;C0042029;C4331837;C3899939;C1553888,C0004600;C4321351;C0013443,20160401,,,Completed,29550099,1,1.0,0.042801900106893,0.034965976015504,adult;;;;;;;;;;English-speaking participants;;;;;;;;;;over the age of 18;;;;;;;;;;come to the emergency department with the chief complaint of low back pain.,"any focal neurological deficit;;;;;;;;;;prior back surgery, acute trauma,;;;;;;;;;;new weakness;;;;;;;;;;new loss bowel/bladder control;;;;;;;;;;back pain above T12;;;;;;;;;;receiving coumadin or plavix;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy.

We hypothesize that treatment based on a person's direction-specific, impairment-based      LBP classification (Classification-specific) will result in better outcomes than Non-specific      treatment. Our approach to classification-directed treatment is based on the proposal that a      person's LBP is the result of adopting direction-specific strategies of movement and      alignment of the spine which then are used repeatedly during the person's everyday      activities. The exposure of spine tissue to repeated loading in the same direction across a      day is proposed to accelerate the accumulation of stress, microtrauma, and eventually LBP. We      also hypothesize that until the factors contributing to the use of the direction-specific      strategies of the spine are modified, the LBP problem will persist or recur. Identification      of homogeneous subgroups of people with LBP will enhance 1) the power of clinical trials, 2)      prognosis, and 3) the ability to identify mechanisms contributing to different LBP problems.",low back pain;classification;spine;,"Nervous System Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0024031;C0087111;C4522152;C0475455,C0024031;C0087111;C4522152;C0475455,C1096775;C1096775;C0020792;C1313880;C0684336;C0684336;C0679199;C0679199;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0033325;C1948033;C1552740;C1552740;C1552740;C1552740;C1552740;C1948033;C0425382;C1552740;C0274281;C1552740;C0033213;C0038435;C0037949;C0037949;C0037949;C1273517;C1561538;C4699604;C0475455;C0033213;C0000589;C4055506;C2911690;C0441606;C0522247;C0681111;C0681111;C0681111;C3858576;C4522152;C0026649,C0004604;C0004600,C0038013;C0003873;C0038016;C0080179;C0019993;C0009566;C0009797;C0029456;C0278134;C0024091;C0152057;C0012691;C0030554;C1458156;C0162340;C0162340;C0231170;C0684331;C0036439;C0009450;C0087111;C0032961;C2115817;C1261287;C3714552;C3245501;C0034927;C0262512;C1551395;C0543467;C0262926;C0012634;C0262926;C1457887;C0033213;C0684224;C0718247;C0006826;C0006826;C0449416;C0596013;C0027651;C1556138;C0030193;C0022742;C0030193;C0019552;C1280910;C4699604;C0677505;C1457887;C2707261;C0606665;C0606665;C0606665,C0004600;C1550472,20101101,,,Completed,21704784;21621668,7,3.5,0.042801900106893,0.026263531237871004,"People who report a history of chronic LBP for a minimum of 12 months,currently are             experiencing LBP symptoms but not in an acute recurrence,;;;;;;;;;;Between 18 and 60 years of age,;;;;;;;;;;Able to stand and walk without assistance,;;;;;;;;;;Able to understand and read English,;;;;;;;;;;Able to understand and sign a consent form","Any structural spinal deformity including scoliosis, kyphosis, or stenosis,;;;;;;;;;;A spinal fracture or dislocation,;;;;;;;;;;Osteoporosis,;;;;;;;;;;Ankylosing spondylitis,;;;;;;;;;;Rheumatoid arthritis,;;;;;;;;;;Disc herniation,;;;;;;;;;;Serious spinal complications such as tumor or infection,;;;;;;;;;;Previous spinal surgery,;;;;;;;;;;Frank neurological loss, i.e., weakness and sensory loss,;;;;;;;;;;Pain or paresthesia below the knee,;;;;;;;;;;Etiology of LBP other than the lumbar spine, e.g., hip joint,;;;;;;;;;;History of neurologic disease which required hospitalization,;;;;;;;;;;Active treatment for cancer,;;;;;;;;;;History of unresolved cancer,;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy,;;;;;;;;;;Magnified symptom behavior,;;;;;;;;;;Worker's compensation or disability case,;;;;;;;;;;In litigation for the LBP problem,;;;;;;;;;;Referral from a specialized pain clinic source,;;;;;;;;;;Spondylolisthesis"
