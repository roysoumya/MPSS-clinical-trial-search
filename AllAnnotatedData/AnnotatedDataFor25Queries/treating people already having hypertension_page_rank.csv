Clear evidence exists that for individuals with high blood pressure      (hypertension) lowering blood pressure really reduces this risk. One of the critical factors      in the long term control of blood pressure is the regular use of effective antihypertensive      medications. In South Africa, poor treatment adherence (attending clinic, re-filling      prescriptions, and regularly taking hypertension tablets) is known to be an important and      alterable risk factor for uncontrolled high blood pressure and its complications (heart      disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease). SMS-text messages have been shown to improve      clinic attendance and medication adherence for some diseases (like HIV and TB) in other      low-resource settings. It is not clear whether SMS-text messages to support treatment      adherence have an effect on long-term blood pressure control. The acceptability,      sustainability and scalability such technology also remains to be determined.      Aim: To investigate if a system of SMS-text messages to support treatment adherence is more      effective than usual care for controlling high blood-pressure.      Objectives: The main objective is to test whether advice and support given by SMS-text,      either by providing information (informational) or by allowing a two-way communication      (interactive) improves control of blood pressure at one year compared to usual care.      Additional objectives include assessing whether the interventions have an effect on,        -  Clinic attendance        -  Prescription refill adherence        -  Self-reported medication adherence        -  Hypertension related illness or death        -  Patient empowerment      Study design: Single centre randomized three-arm parallel group trial As it is not clear how      best to support treatment adherence for people with hypertension we need to compare the      different ways this might be done. Eligible patients who provide written consent will be put      into one of three groups and then compared. The groups are selected by a computer which has      no information about the individual (i.e. by chance). Participants in each group will get      different types of SMS-text messages and these are compared.      Study interventions:        -  Enhanced usual care In addition to their usual clinical care participants will receive           the pre-randomisation ""Welcome to the *StAR Study"" SMS-text, a ""Happy Birthday"" SMS-text           on their date of birth and up to six additional SMS-text messages containing study           specific information and thanking the participant for taking part in the study.        -  Informational SMS-text messages In addition to enhanced usual care, participants           allocated to the informational SMS-text support group will receive semi-tailored           structured adherence-support (including clinic appointment and medication pick-up           reminders, medication adherence support and hypertension-related education.)        -  Interactive SMS-text messages In addition to enhanced usual care and informational           SMS-text messages, SMS-text messages sent to participants in the interactive SMS-text           group will contain a ""prompt to respond"" which will guide participants to additional           SMS-text based resources.      Outcome measures: The main outcome measure is mean blood pressure measured at one year.      Additional outcomes include the proportion of participants with ""controlled blood pressure""      as well as measures of clinic attendance, prescription refill adherence, self-reported      medication adherence, hypertension related illness or death, and patient empowerment.",SMS-text;mobile health;mHealth;treatment;adherence;,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0005823;C4553491;C0020538;C0470166;C1171411;C1527021;C1550655;C0184511,C0005823;C0020538;C0087111;C4554418;C0220825;C1171411;C1171411;C0947630;C1561557;C1527021;C1527021;C0446516;C0470166;C3897779;C0376691,C1753303;C1753303;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0428886;C0149761;C0003364;C0022658;C0005823;C0022658;C0005823;C0005823;C0018799;C0033080;C0009566;C3242430;C0886296;C0886296;C0421451;C3242430;C3242430;C0020538;C0020538;C0033080;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0035648;C0013227;C0035648;C0013227;C0018017;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0018017;C0087111;C0424927;C2348629;C0470166;C0012634;C0470166;C0470166;C0460139;C0700287;C0470166;C0470166;C1552740;C0470166;C0470166;C0470166;C0470166;C0700287;C3812897;C1171411;C0012634;C0221423;C1550655;C0221423;C0038454;C0038454;C1518681;C0150600;C1518681;C1549113;C1552839;C1552839;C0947630;C1709157;C0018787;C0005767;C3244317;C0011065;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0018592;C0947630;C0947630;C0011065;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C0392366;C1527021;C1561543;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1527021;C1561543;C1551994;C1550472;C2948600;C0446516;C0018017;C1820370;C3242430;C0542559;C0184511;C1555587;C3242430;C3242430;C3242430;C4082977;C0233492;C0233492;C0233492;C4693928;C2911690;C0870427;C4084912;C4084912;C0699530;C0011167;C1552839;C0018792;C1552839;C1552839;C1552839;C3242613;C0449416;C1547298;C0184511;C4554418;C3272565;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129,C0020538,C0428886;C0005823;C0020538;C0232973;C3665347;C0013227;C0020899;C0011900;C3272565;C0023185;C0600109;C0684224;C1552850;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C1299581;C1527021;C1552861;C1551994;C1820370;C0009797;C4055646;C0332534;C1561542;C1555709;C0018792;C1549439;C1549439,,20140801,,,Completed,29361934;26769742;26137844;24410738,51,12.75,0.0030170409802190005,0.004569832613919001,"Clinical diagnosis of hypertension and are either currently receiving or are about to             start blood pressure lowering medication;;;;;;;;;;Mean blood pressure at enrolment is < 175/105;;;;;;;;;;Aged 21 years or older;;;;;;;;;;Must have access to a cell-phone (shared access is allowed if access is daily and the             phone owner agrees to participate);;;;;;;;;;Must be able to use SMS-text (help by a partner is allowed for illiterate subjects,             subjects with poor vision, or subjects who are learning disabled);;;;;;;;;;Must be resident in the study area and must be expected to be resident for the             duration of the study","Another member of the household has already been recruited into the trial;;;;;;;;;;If female, they are not pregnant or within three months post-partum by self-report;;;;;;;;;;They are not willing to give informed consent and take part in the study."

Cardiovascular prognosis in patients with RH is worse than in      controlled hypertensives. Efferent renal sympathetic nerves play an important role in volume      homeostasis and blood pressure. A novel minimally invasive technique based on the use of      selective radiofrequency renal sympathetic denervation has shown promising preliminary      results for the treatment of these patients. On the other hand, some patients with RH could      improve their blood pressure control by adding spironolactone, an antagonist of aldosterone      receptors.      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency renal sympathetic denervation in      patients with RH, as compared with the addition of spironolactone to the therapeutic regimen      at baseline.      Method: interventional, prospective, randomized, open study, of a cohort of 50 patients with      RH, with office systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg and also with 24h systolic blood pressure      ≥ 140 mmHg, despite treatment with ≥ 3 drugs in adequate doses, one of them a diuretic, and      whitout treatment with either spironolactone or eplerenone. Patients will be randomized (1:1)      to renal sympathetic denervation treatment or spironolactone (50mg), performing determination      of office blood pressure and 24h-ABPM at pre-randomization, 1, 3 and 6 months, as well as      laboratory tests, echocardiography, measurement of carotid intima-media thickness and central      blood pressure measurement at pre-randomization and after 6 months.",,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0013216;C0020538;C0011307;C1514892;C0003842;C0022646,C0013216;C0020538;C0011307;C1514892;C0003842;C0022646,C0039038;C0039038;C0871470;C0871470;C0039038;C0022885;C0013516;C0005823;C3887460;C0005823;C0005823;C0037982;C0037982;C0037982;C0037982;C0005823;C0005823;C1148554;C0020538;C0857121;C0020538;C0002006;C0961485;C0033325;C0087111;C0018017;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0012798;C0012634;C0040808;C0040808;C0741968;C0027740;C0025663;C0013227;C1457868;C0022646;C0679622;C0022646;C0022646;C0947630;C0013227;C0022646;C0600138;C1704326;C0018563;C0857121;C0087111;C0184661;C1550655;C0184511;C0381385;C0776963;C2911690;C2246906;C1716046;C0202165;C0202165;C1514892;C4084912;C1561542;C1561542;C0939710;C1334278;C0220825;C0728774,C0020538,C0017654;C0855316;C0871470;C0003364;C0155616;C0018824;C0020538;C1561643;C1561643;C0027051;C0879626;C0302353;C0002965;C0005823;C0037982;C1611825;C0268790;C0002978;C0002978;C0002006;C0150369;C0961485;C0011900;C0087111;C0087111;C0231881;C0087111;C0087111;C0424092;C0012798;C0460139;C3245501;C0039082;C0005847;C0549206;C0005847;C0040808;C0012634;C0020517;C0012634;C3244317;C0005767;C3244317;C0947630;C0392366;C0037313;C0003578;C0022646;C0456387;C0013227;C1300072;C0022646;C0947630;C3245479;C0392366;C0087111;C0087111;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C0009797;C1979715;C0237834;C1514892;C0449900;C1561542;C1561542;C4331837;C1995642;C0750558;C4086490,C1140111,20151201,,,Completed,27327441,4,4.0,0.002963827178418,0.004317747192961,"Subjects aged ΓëÍ 18 years and ΓëÁ 80 years.;;;;;;;;;;Subjects with diagnosed resistant arterial hypertension (office blood pressure ΓëÍ 140             and/or 90 mm Hg despite treatment with at least 3 antihypertensive drugs given at the             maximum tolerated therapeutic dosage, being one of them a diuretic), with this             therapeutic regimen maintained for at least the last 3 months.;;;;;;;;;;Office systolic blood pressure ΓëÍ150 mm Hg, with confirmation of resistance to             treatment by 24h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, with 24h-systolic blood             pressure ΓëÍ140 mmHg being required to be included.;;;;;;;;;;Patients who have freely given informed consent in writing, after the nature of the             study and the disclosure of their data have been explained to them.","1.

Examination of the fundus: Grade III and Grade IV","Resistant hypertension (ReHy) is an emerging clinical and public health problem which tends      to increase because populations are living longer and there is a growing global epidemic of      obesity, diabetes and sleep apnea. It is also tempting to speculate that the excessive      dietary salt ingestion reported in many countries can contribute substantially to the risk of      ReHy development. ReHy is defined as persistent high blood pressure (above the target goal)      in spite of the use of at least 3 antihypertensive agents of different classes, one of them      must being diuretics.      Data regarding the exact prevalence of ReHy are very limited. In addition, little data is      available about 3-drug combinations but a simplified treatment algorithm has demonstrated      that a combination of a diuretic plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or      an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) plus diuretic, adding a calcium channel blocker when      necessary, controlled 64% of hypertensive patients and, in addition, was even more efficient      than the current guideline-based management. By contrast, the fourth drug to be added-on the      triple regimen is still controversial and guided by empirical choices or personal      preferences. Recent studies suggest the emerging role of spironolactone as the ""first-line""      fourth drug for treating resistant hypertension. Conversely, because of the      pathophysiological rationale, others have proposed the use of β-blockers or even centrally      acting agents for managing the sympathetic hyperactivity. The present concerns about the      limited blood pressure reducing effect of β-blockers, especially in elderly people, the      potent effect of centrally acting agents and our personal experience are pointing to      clonidine as the fourth drug to be added-on to a multidrug combination for reaching optimal      blood pressure in patients with ReHy. Nevertheless, no studies have been performed comparing,      head-to-head, which one is the best fourth drug (spironolactone or clonidine) to be added-on      to a common used multidrug combination in order to treat this condition.      Therefore, the principal objectives of the ReHOT Trial are to assess prospectively: (1) the      prevalence of ReHy in a cohort of outpatients with stage II hypertension; (2) the effect of      spironolactone on blood pressure, in comparison to clonidine, when added to a multidrug      combination consisting of chlorthalidone plus ACEi (or ARB) plus amlodipine, all of 3      up-titrated to the highest dose; (3) the role of measuring sympathetic nervous system      activity and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activity on predicting the response of blood      pressure to spironolactone and clonidine.",Resistant Hypertension;,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0020538;C1514892;C0087111,C0020792;C0020538;C0087111;C1514892;C1550655;C0947630;C1550655,C0003364;C0006684;C0020538;C0014432;C0037982;C0005823;C0005823;C0037982;C0037982;C0005823;C0008294;C0037982;C0699943;C0424295;C0020538;C3539181;C0857121;C0020538;C0020538;C0037315;C0243107;C0003018;C0003018;C0003018;C0002006;C0376636;C0237607;C0018017;C0051696;C1514892;C0012798;C0087111;C0002045;C0282423;C0009014;C0009014;C0012634;C0009014;C0009014;C0011849;C0700287;C0012798;C0012798;C1704632;C0460139;C0033213;C0028754;C0456387;C0040808;C0947630;C0150312;C0947630;C0027769;C3539125;C1518681;C1518681;C3245511;C1518681;C1300072;C0005767;C0037494;C0018017;C3245479;C0013227;C1704326;C0013227;C0013227;C0018670;C0018670;C0013227;C1273517;C1704326;C3539181;C3539181;C3539181;C3539181;C3845947;C4684637;C0776963;C1979715;C1514811;C2911690;C3653883;C1514892;C0449900;C0776963;C0776963;C0776963;C1522411;C0776963;C4697740;C0037816;C1707944;C3272565;C1707944;C1548344;C0201956;C4049938;C4049938;C3834249;C0277785;C0546816,C0020538,C0189573;C0871470;C0488055;C0018824;C1320716;C0948807;C0442867;C0277814;C0183427;C0020517;C0018801;C0700589;C0020538;C1548428;C0003811;C0031809;C0162791;C0001973;C0221423;C0032961;C0450094;C4684790;C0442711;C0004245;C4050001;C1550655;C0262926;C0542560;C0262512;C0038454;C0740422;C0022646;C0456387;C0013227;C0947630;C2948499;C0593946;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C4699613;C0332448;C3714738;C0012000;C0238815;C1561542;C1300072;C0016590,C0020538;C1514892,20140701,,,Unknown status,29463627;24338935,7,3.5,0.003841640984339,0.004134679839079,"Patients aged between 18 and 75;;;;;;;;;;With systolic blood pressure> 160 mmHg and <220mmHg and / or diastolic> 100 mmHg in             the sitting position and according to Brazilian Guidelines on Hypertension (perform             steps by obtaining two consecutive measurements differing by less than 4 mmHg between             them, calibrated using a sphygmomanometer);;;;;;;;;;Patient regularly enrolled in participating center","Systolic blood pressure> 220 mmHg;;;;;;;;;;Patients with cardiovascular events (stroke, AMI, etc.). or cardiovascular procedures             with less than 6 months of evolution;;;;;;;;;;Renal stages IV and V (glomerular20 filtration estimated by MDRD formula <30 ml / min;             where MDRD = 186 x (S_Cr) -1.154 x (age) -0.203 x (0.742 if fem.) x (1.210 if             Afro-amer. ));;;;;;;;;;Heart failure class III and IV;;;;;;;;;;History of malignant disease with life expectancy < 2 years;;;;;;;;;;Alcoholism;;;;;;;;;;Psychiatric illnesses that prevent compliance with the Protocol;;;;;;;;;;Women of childbearing age who are not in use of effective contraception;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy;;;;;;;;;;Arrhythmias, valvular heart disease, AV block 2 and 3 degrees without MP;;;;;;;;;;Hepatic impairment;;;;;;;;;;Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the drugs under study;;;;;;;;;;Examination of the fundus: Grade III and Grade IV"

Data will be stored in an electronic database located in the Coordinating Centre, to which        GPs may have access for uploading data on a daily base, using personal, encrypted, login        and password. These data will be stored in the central database. After local        echocardiographic evaluation, patients showing left ventricular Ejection Fraction < 45%        will be excluded from the study.","Background: The use of thiazide diuretics in the treatment of hypertension (HT) is widely      considered a first line treatment, given the efficacy and low cost of this class of drugs.      This indication is not unanimous, because thiazides can cause metabolic alterations and other      side effects increasing cardiac and cerebrovascular risk, which reduce compliance to      treatment and increase health care system cost. However, large intervention trials in HT      suggest that the improvement in cardiovascular prognosis of HT patients depends more on      follow-up procedures than on type of drug used. Furthermore, the investigators have      documented improved compliance to antihypertensive therapy by implementing cooperation      between general practitioners (GPs) and HT specialists.      Objectives: In a multicenter, open label randomized study the investigators will compare the      persistence on therapy of thiazides versus other treatments, as a first line antihypertensive      therapy, in a clinical setting characterized by a strict cooperation between GPs and HT      specialist. The investigators will also analyse candidate genes with impact on drug-induced      metabolic alterations to elucidate the pathophysiology of these phenomena.      Methods: 260 GPs will recruit 2600 hypertensive patients with indication to pharmacological      treatment and randomise them to starting treatment with chlortalidone (12.5 to 25 mg daily,      1300 pts) or a GP decided single drug (excluding thiazides) or combination therapy at highest      tolerated dose. In both groups any other class of antihypertensive drugs can be added over      time in order to achieve blood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg). Follow-up will last 2 years.      Blood sample and urine analyses, carotid and cardiac ultrasound will be performed at baseline      and scheduled time points. Genotyping will be performed by sequencing. Data will be collected      and stored using a web based centralized Case Report Form (CRF) Expected results: Results      will highlight whether a follow-up strategy based on tight cooperation between GPs and HT      specialists can allow the use of thiazides as first line antihypertensive therapy without any      negative effect on persistence, adherence and efficacy of the treatment. These data can be      used to reduce total burden of the Health Care System in HT by replacing more expensive drugs      with diuretics in the 50% of hypertensive patients, who do not receive this class of drugs.      Furthermore, the pharmacogenetic approach may clarify the pathophysiological mechanisms of      drug-induced metabolic side effects",treatment;adverse events;adherence;gene;polymorphism;,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0020538;C0012798;C0947630,C4084975;C0012798;C0087111;C0718247;C1550655;C0857121,C0585941;C0585941;C0003364;C0009429;C0012802;C0595938;C1655737;C0003364;C1516308;C0277785;C3887460;C0005823;C0008294;C0020538;C0184661;C0857121;C0857121;C0877248;C0086388;C0546816;C0546816;C0086388;C1301725;C0087111;C1285573;C0087111;C0087111;C0541746;C0087111;C0033325;C0541746;C0087111;C0087111;C0541746;C0541746;C0087111;C0012798;C0184511;C1517001;C0679199;C0205160;C0018787;C0087111;C0087111;C0542559;C0025663;C0741968;C0087136;C1552839;C1518681;C3244317;C0456387;C0013227;C1705425;C0947630;C0456387;C0005767;C0042036;C0013227;C0456387;C0013227;C0013227;C1273517;C0013227;C0013227;C3245479;C1273517;C0013227;C1550472;C0010132;C0184661;C0018017;C0086960;C4699613;C0725813;C2825142;C0441621;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C3714738;C3714738;C1294197;C3844714;C2707259;C2707259;C2707259;C0776963;C1522411;C1254223;C2347500;C2735115;C3272565;C0728774;C4534364;C0277785;C1854293;C1854293;C4698129,C0020538,C0018802;C0085580;C0003364;C0155616;C0700589;C0543421;C0543421;C0013516;C0201976;C0201976;C0023890;C0005823;C0042014;C0022658;C0020538;C0013216;C0020538;C0020538;C0013227;C0277785;C0018827;C0220825;C0041618;C0162791;C0162791;C1301725;C0220825;C0332155;C0332155;C0087111;C0022423;C0199230;C0032821;C0032961;C3245501;C0549206;C0442711;C0018787;C0242356;C0242356;C1554103;C0741968;C3812897;C0017725;C0015895;C0028678;C0262926;C0012634;C0033213;C0010957;C0087136;C0006826;C0205082;C0178784;C0042036;C1300072;C0947630;C1552850;C0005767;C0042036;C0392366;C0005767;C0456387;C0947630;C0013227;C1561543;C3245479;C3245479;C0042789;C0183129;C1444657;C0202236;C1552867;C1550655;C1552867;C1552867;C0009797;C0857121;C0427184;C0201950;C0201950;C4684637;C0776963;C1550043;C2911690;C0376636;C0043084;C0944988;C0202236;C0016538;C1561542;C1550488;C0201956;C1709475;C0812388,,20100301,,,Completed,25695618;24956971,10,5.0,0.003895037730745,0.003957682024425001,"Hypertensive patients will be 18 to 75-year old.;;;;;;;;;;Eligible patients will be asked for written informed consent and thereafter referred             to the identified Hypertension Specialist Centre located in their areas, for end-organ             damage evaluation by echocardiography, carotid ultrasound and urine dip-stick.;;;;;;;;;;Eligible patients are required to have stage Ic or II essential hypertension, and to             be previously untreated or poorly controlled.

There      is also experimental evidence that both TLR4 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)      participate in the pathogenesis of experimental pulmonary hypertension. A recent high      throughput screen for inhibitors of HMGB1 induced macrophage activation yielded HIV-protease      inhibitors (PIs) as potent inhibitors of HMGB1 induced cytokine production. Based on the      experimental evidence we propose a trial to determine whether HIV-PIs will alter the      pathobiology of PAH.      Study Objectives:The main objective of this study is to determine whether saquinavir and      ritonavir (SQV+RIT) which have a well-characterized safety profile in humans will reduce bio      markers of inflammation and pulmonary artery pressures in patients with PAH.      Study Hypothesis:We hypothesize that the HIV-PI, SQV+RIT, will reduce circulating parameters      of inflammation including HMGB1, IL1-beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha and CRP. Our end      points will be changes in these parameters from baseline over the duration of the study.We      hypothesize that treatment with SQV+RIT will reduce pulmonary artery(PA) pressure of patients      with PAH as measured by echocardiography.      Study Design:This is a single center open label phase 0 study to evaluate the effect of SQV      +RIT in patients with IPAH. Subjects with IPAH(N=20) will be enrolled into a study, which      will be divided into 3 cohorts and entail the administration of HIV protease inhibitors in      three doses. The first cohort (n=3) will receive a starting dose of SQV 0.3 mg/kg twice daily      in combination with RIT 0.03 mg/kg twice daily. If the first dose is well-tolerated, the      second cohort (n= 3 ) with IPAH will be given doses of SQV 3 mg/kg and RIT 0.3 mg/kg twice      daily. If the second dose is well-tolerated, the last cohort (n= 14 ) with IPAH will be given      doses of SQV 15 mg/kg and RIT 1.5 mg/kg twice daily.",,Cardiovascular Diseases;Respiratory Tract Diseases;,C0162714;C0021368;C0020538;C2707265;C2707265;C0003842;C0184511;C4281788;C2954564,C1140111,C0428642;C0162714;C0162714;C0020542;C0020538;C0920262;C0086272;C1327413;C4684758;C0013516;C1533734;C4281788;C0699748;C0021368;C0021368;C2983265;C0286738;C0024109;C0024109;C0018017;C0292818;C0087111;C0024109;C0425245;C0030946;C0460139;C4684790;C0199230;C0087136;C1518681;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0439095;C0947630;C1705425;C0947630;C0947630;C3244317;C3244317;C3539181;C0018017;C0184511;C0005516;C0332534;C1328018;C1328018;C1552839;C0018792;C0441229;C0728774;C0220825;C2945733;C4082977;C4082977,C0152171,C3203102;C0428772;C0521317;C0403447;C0007193;C0678798;C0428883;C0019029;C0240709;C0018795;C0871470;C0745213;C0020538;C0341439;C0507816;C0020541;C0001973;C0948807;C3831116;C0009324;C0700586;C0282335;C0011849;C0034052;C0201976;C0013516;C0010068;C0020517;C1115771;C3245491;C3245491;C0043091;C0007165;C1533734;C0459471;C1533734;C0005794;C1533734;C0020473;C0018799;C0683954;C0020456;C0009871;C0489625;C0020649;C0019163;C0019196;C0002978;C2945640;C0553700;C0011900;C0750484;C0199230;C0023890;C0009450;C0199230;C0220908;C0199230;C0009450;C1301746;C0460139;C1619636;C0011946;C0022116;C0022423;C0012634;C0043144;C3854058;C0332149;C0087111;C0277814;C0277814;C0262512;C0262926;C0262512;C0001962;C0004048;C0221423;C0543467;C0262926;C0456387;C0015663;C0017725;C0262926;C0012634;C0012634;C0600109;C1561610;C1553386;C1547311;C0205082;C0205082;C0004096;C0025344;C0032105;C0032105;C0032105;C0199230;C0947630;C0947630;C1546725;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C0947630;C0947630;C0010200;C0947630;C0013227;C0947630;C0595998;C0947630;C0947630;C0229671;C0021853;C0947630;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C1114365;C4021768;C1550655;C1457887;C1550655;C1550655;C0009797;C0009797;C1548428;C0237284;C0040399;C4684637;C3842337;C4684637;C4684637;C3842337;C4684637;C3842337;C4684637;C1320102;C1320102;C0185026;C2911690;C3272565;C0220825;C0562357;C0332534;C1561542;C4331837;C4331837;C0021141;C0231221;C1334180;C0728774;C1547226;C3245501;C0087130,C1140111,20150701,,,Unknown status,26401255,0,0.0,0.002881209895505999,0.003891131693682,"Age 18-60;;;;;;;;;;Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension;;;;;;;;;;Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that             the subject (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all             pertinent aspects of the study;;;;;;;;;;Had the diagnosis of PAH confirmed by a cardiac catheterization:Mean pulmonary artery             pressure (mPAP) ΓëÍ 25 mm Hg (at rest)∩╝ða pulmonary capillary wedge pressure equal or             less than 15mmHg, and a normal or reduced cardiac output;;;;;;;;;;Stable PAH therapy for at least 3 months","Baseline systemic hypotension, defined as MAP less than 50 mmHg;;;;;;;;;;Required intravenous inotropes within 30 days prior to study participation;;;;;;;;;;Has uncontrolled systemic hypertension as evidenced by sitting systolic blood pressure             >160 mm Hg or sitting diastolic blood pressure >100 mm Hg at screening;;;;;;;;;;Has a history of portal hypertension or chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis,             chronic alcoholism, hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C (with evidence of recent infection             and/or active virus replication) defined as moderate to severe hepatic impairment             (Child-Pugh Class B-C);;;;;;;;;;Has chronic renal insufficiency as defined by serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL at screening             or requires dialysis support;;;;;;;;;;Has a hemoglobin concentration <9 g/dL at Screening;;;;;;;;;;History of atrial septostomy;;;;;;;;;;Repaired or unrepaired congenital heart disease (CHD);;;;;;;;;;Pericardial constriction;;;;;;;;;;Restrictive or congestive cardiomyopathy;;;;;;;;;;Left ventricular ejection fraction 40% by multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA),             angiography or echocardiography;;;;;;;;;;Symptomatic coronary disease with demonstrable ischemia;;;;;;;;;;Other severe acute or chronic medical or laboratory abnormality that may increase the             risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study;;;;;;;;;;Has a psychiatric, addictive or other disorder that compromises the ability to give             informed consent for participating in this study.

NCT01995812,0,Ola Hou i ka Hula: Hula and Hypertension,Ola Hou i ka Hula: A Pilot Study to Investigate Hula and Hypertension Control,Hypertension;,,"Inclusion Criteria:          -  Adult (age > 18) with blood pressure >140/90 or >130/80 if also diagnosed with             diabetes          -  Under a physicians care for hypertension for at least 6 months          -  Prescribed 2-3 hypertension medications          -  Independently ambulatory          -  Approval of participation from primary care physician or cardiologist        Exclusion Criteria:          -  Prescribed more than 4, or only 1 hypertension medication          -  Severe cognitive dysfunction precluding informed consent and understanding of hula          -  Pregnancy at time or during the study period","Physical activity is an important lifestyle modification for individuals with high blood      pressure. It is part of national cardiac care guidelines for hypertension management that      recommends, along with prescribing medication, lifestyle modification be promoted for      improved dietary intake, and participation in about 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.      Native Hawaiians and other Pacific peoples (NHPP) have among the highest risk for the heart      disease, with mortality rates twice other ethnic groups. In many minority populations,      including NHPP, hypertension develops at an early age, is more severe and is less likely to      be controlled. Despite the ability of physical activity to reduce blood pressure, the      majority of U.S. population, do not meet physical activity recommendations and new      interventions that can improve accessibility and adherence, particularly among at-risk      minority populations are needed.      In this research, Hypertension and Hula: Ola Hou Pilot Study, we plan to evaluate a      culturally relevant intervention that uses hula and is consistent with the goals of      recommended physical activity for improved lifestyle - moderate-intensity, prolonged physical      activity cumulatively at about 150 minutes per week. Hula, the traditional dance form of      Native Hawaiians, is commonly practiced in Hawai'i as a cultural practice, form of creative      expression, and exercise that is structured on controlled, rhythmic movements. Combining      aspects of meditation, music, self-awareness with low-impact aerobic exercise, traditional      hula may be particularly suitable to individuals with limited mobility and fitness and within      the recommended paradigm for exercise training and secondary prevention of coronary artery      disease (CAD). We anticipate a hula and heart health education program will be particularly      appealing to Native Hawaiians and other Pacific people (NHPP) including Pacific Islanders and      Filipino who suffer from a significant disparity in cardiovascular health.      Specifically, we will determine if individuals with poorly managed hypertension and      randomized to a 12-week hula and heart health education intervention will demonstrate better      blood pressure levels, functional capacity, and exercise tolerance (6-minute walk test) than      individuals randomized to a usual care group. We will also assess if the individuals in the      hula intervention report better health-related quality of life, stress management,      perceptions of discrimination, and exercise self efficacy.",,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0020538,C0020538;C0947630;C1564718,C0679699;C1998319;C0162521;C0430515;C0150788;C0001701;C0700572;C0205042;C0518214;C1286104;C0005823;C3146223;C3887460;C0005823;C0012632;C0886296;C0600564;C0150158;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0184661;C0020538;C0184661;C0184661;C0278329;C0030971;C0162791;C0376636;C0013227;C0185117;C0150277;C0424927;C0424927;C0031809;C0460139;C0184511;C0184511;C0237607;C0012634;C0012634;C0680174;C1552839;C0205082;C0332148;C0683278;C0684224;C0005767;C0018787;C0947630;C0018017;C0026867;C0018787;C0018787;C1561540;C1561540;C1578513;C1550472;C0454330;C0454330;C0237607;C0452240;C0452240;C0442694;C0016095;C0184511;C3840684;C3840684;C0040399;C0233492;C2911690;C2911690;C0178520;C0178520;C0178520;C4084912;C0026649;C4699552;C0729829;C1552839;C0030851;C4049938;C3854058;C1547226;C0220825;C1547226;C0031809;C4049938;C0886384;C0886384;C3840775;C4698129;C0151872;C4082977,C0020538,C0684167;C0684167;C0338656;C0005823;C0162340;C0020538;C0033137;C1561560;C0011900;C0032961;C0011849;C2346845;C0205082;C0025344;C0947630;C0009797;C1299583;C0278329;C0278329;C0804815;C1561542,C1140111,20130501,,,Completed,27294768,7,7.0,0.008356259928436,0.003766369536183,Adult (age > 18) with blood pressure >140/90 or >130/80 if also diagnosed with             diabetes;;;;;;;;;;Under a physicians care for hypertension for at least 6 months;;;;;;;;;;Prescribed 2-3 hypertension medications;;;;;;;;;;Independently ambulatory;;;;;;;;;;Approval of participation from primary care physician or cardiologist,"Prescribed more than 4, or only 1 hypertension medication;;;;;;;;;;Severe cognitive dysfunction precluding informed consent and understanding of hula;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy at time or during the study period"

Background: Cupping is an ancient treatment remedy that has been used for many centuries in      many parts of the world. In the Middle East, Wet cupping ""Hijama"" is still a popular      treatment because of its religious background. Despite of that, it still has little      scientific evidence that proves its efficacy. Many hijama healers claim that they have      observed dramatic improvement in Blood pressure control of hypertension patients. Not many      studies support that. This study should help to prove or disprove this hypothesis.      Objectives:        -  To determine the efficacy of wet cupping on blood pressure among high blood pressure           patients.        -  To assess the incidence of wet cupping side effects in the intervention group.      Methods: The study design is a randomised controlled trial.

In the      pathogenesis of AH increased BP is a result of complex mechanisms i. e. fluid retention,      increased vascular resistance and hyperkinetic heart function. Impedance cardiography (ICG)      is a simple and safe, non-invasive method of hemodynamic monitoring which allows simultaneous      assessment of i. e. BP, cardiac index, heart rate, the fluid content in the chest and      systemic vascular resistance.      The detailed effect of treatment based on ICG has not been evaluated so far in the long-term      observation and for other clinically relevant parameters, such as central blood pressure,      left ventricular hypertrophy, metabolic disturbances, parameters of antioxidative-oxidative      balance and endothelial function. Therefore, the following main objectives of the study were      defined:        -  Evaluation of usefulness of impedance cardiography in optimizing treatment of patients           with hypertension in the area of reduction and control of blood pressure, hemodynamic           parameters, biochemical markers and quality of life.        -  Evaluation of complex pathophysiological mechanisms associated with hypertension           including hemodynamic, anthropometric, psychological and biochemical parameters as well           as the effect of antihypertensive treatment on these phenomena.      The study will be randomized (1:1), prospective and controlled in parallel with conventional      treatment. The subjects will be divided into groups according to the pre-established random      order:        1. empiric group (GE), in which treatment choice will be based on clinical data and current           guidelines        2. hemodynamic group (HD), in which treatment choice will be based on clinical data and           current guidelines considering hemodynamic parameters established with ICG method.      All patients will undergo a detailed examination three times: before treatment, then after 3      and 12 months of treatment.      The authors expect that the study will consolidate the importance of ICG in the diagnosis of      patients with AH. Simultaneous multiparametric evaluation of the subjects guarantees a unique      and innovative results which can enhance our knowledge in pathophysiology of AH and      reversibility of adverse mechanisms associated with this disease.",arterial hypertension;hemodynamics;impedance cardiography;hypotensive therapy;,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0020538;C0031809;C4281788;C1455871,C0020538;C0031809;C0011900;C0087111;C1979963;C4281788;C1455871,C1258192;C0149721;C1753303;C4082936;C0007185;C0020538;C0042380;C0337629;C0003364;C0268000;C0518214;C0277785;C0005823;C0428776;C1306597;C1516606;C1516606;C0699748;C0221533;C0020538;C0020538;C0700325;C4281788;C4281788;C4281788;C4281788;C0031809;C0031809;C0018810;C0018017;C0220825;C0220825;C0162791;C0162791;C0220825;C0162537;C0087111;C0087111;C4551656;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0011900;C0376554;C0031843;C0031843;C0014653;C0012634;C0025663;C1518681;C1518681;C1552839;C0025663;C0018787;C0817096;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0746556;C4699604;C1552853;C4684637;C0005516;C0723323;C2911690;C2075796;C4084912;C0220825;C1522411;C1552839;C1552839;C1334278;C4554418;C0939261;C0939261;C0277785;C0151576;C0151576,C0020538,C0003364;C1135191;C0022661;C0003811;C0042373;C0005893;C0878544;C0152025;C0004936;C1292856;C0332155;C0750484;C0027627;C0024109;C0012634;C0011849;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C0205082;C0871269;C1300072;C0018787;C0018787;C0497247;C0333166;C0543467;C2911690;C2911690;C0442726;C0013227;C0804815;C1561542;C1300072;C4699193,C0087111;C0003842,20171201,,,Completed,26876066,0,0.0,0.0027540248689440004,0.003674317863783,untreated AH (elevated BP values ΓëÍ 3 months) and insufficiently controlled AH by one             or two antihypertensive drugs.,"confirmed secondary AH,;;;;;;;;;;improperly controlled AH with three or more medicines;;;;;;;;;;chronic renal failure in the third and higher stages of the disease,;;;;;;;;;;other severe concomitant diseases: systolic heart failure, cardiomyopathy, significant             cardiac arrhythmia, significant valvular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary             disease (stage C/D), diabetes, previously undetected, polyneuropathy, peripheral             vascular disease,;;;;;;;;;;body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/m2,;;;;;;;;;;mental illness, preventing cooperation with the physician,;;;;;;;;;;heart rhythm other than sinus (including, i.e. constant heart stimulation),"

Short-term intervention studies indicate that      high doses of cocoa improve endothelial function and reduce blood pressure (BP), but the      clinical impact of long-term intake of small dietary amounts of cocoa on BP and the      underlying BP lowering mechanisms are unclear. We hypothesized that cocoa consumption lowers      blood pressure by augmentation of the circulating vasodilative nitric oxide (NO) pool due to      the action of the cocoa polyphenols at the vascular endothelium.      To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a randomized single-blind, parallel group study in      subjects with mild essential hypertension to evaluate the effects of polyphenol-rich dark      chocolate versus polyphenol-free white chocolate on blood pressure and plasma levels of cocoa      phenols, circulating bioactive nitric oxide, and plasma markers of oxidative stress. After a      7 day cocoa-free run-in period, 44 subjects will be 1:1 randomized to receive over 18 weeks      daily doses of either dark chocolate (6.3 g per day with a total of 30 mg of polyphenols and      30 kcal) or polyphenol free white chocolate (5.6 g per day with 30 kcal, containing similar      amounts of macronutrients, electrolytes and vitamins). Subjects will be counseled to maintain      an isocaloric diet and to abstain from other cocoa products during the study. Blood pressure      and plasma parameters will be assessed in each subject after the run-in period and after 6,      12, and 18 weeks of treatment.",,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0005823;C0020538;C1138626;C1547225,C0005823;C0020538;C2911690;C2728194;C4554418;C1549113;C1561557;C0947630;C1547225;C1561574;C3897779,C0085580;C1096775;C3887460;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C0005823;C1293122;C0028128;C0028128;C0013832;C0071649;C0071649;C0071649;C0071649;C0071649;C0939909;C0939909;C0939909;C0939909;C0087111;C0031843;C0005847;C0042890;C0947630;C0031428;C0087136;C0032105;C0032105;C0038435;C0025344;C0032105;C0025344;C0939909;C0939909;C0939909;C0939909;C0939909;C0456909;C0947630;C0939909;C0939909;C0939909;C0947630;C0392366;C1561538;C0600140;C1561538;C1561538;C0600140;C1820370;C1964257;C0184511;C1947907;C1518681;C0005516;C3540799;C4067746;C1552839;C3272565;C4554418;C0220825,C0020538,C0017178;C0585941;C0004936;C0029216;C0858034;C0011849;C0022658;C1510472;C0424575;C0005823;C0005823;C0455280;C0455280;C0005823;C3887460;C1278073;C0020538;C0020538;C0005779;C0019163;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0071649;C0424092;C2707265;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C1446409;C0015663;C0205054;C0001962;C0036572;C0262926;C0543467;C0042890;C0600109;C1553386;C0024763;C0231683;C1553386;C0087136;C0006826;C0566415;C1512346;C0947630;C0392366;C0918012;C0577559;C3540798;C0184661;C4699604;C0242297;C1552867;C1552867;C1552867;C0009797;C0012262;C0031843;C1512346;C1550488;C3843408;C1550518;C1947943,C1140111,20050501,,,Completed,17609490,70,70.0,0.00286620513821,0.003636829315643,"Subjects between the ages of 55 - 75 years in good general health with high normal             blood pressure (between 130/80 and 140/90 mmHg) or mild hypertension (blood pressure             between 140/90 and 160/100 mmHg)on no medication or nutritional supplements;;;;;;;;;;Non-manual workers with a household income > 20,000 Γé¼/year;;;;;;;;;;Normal plasma lipids (total plasma cholesterol < 6.18 mmol/L;;;;;;;;;;LDL < 4.11 mmol/L;;;;;;;;;;HDL > 0.9 mmol/L;;;;;;;;;;Triacylglycerols < 1.8 mmol/L) and normal plasma glucose (fasting plasma glucose             4.2-6.4 mmol/L).;;;;;;;;;;If a subject's blood pressure exceeds 170/100 mmHg on a single visit, the subject will             be withdrawn from the study and referred to appropriate antihypertensive therapy.","Subjects are excluded if they have:;;;;;;;;;;Cardiovascular diseases (other than hypertension);;;;;;;;;;Diabetes mellitus;;;;;;;;;;Hyper-/dyslipidemia;;;;;;;;;;Gastrointestinal diseases;;;;;;;;;;Hepatic and renal disorders;;;;;;;;;;Pulmonary diseases;;;;;;;;;;Coagulopathy;;;;;;;;;;Cancer;;;;;;;;;;Psychiatric disorders;;;;;;;;;;Alcohol or drug dependence;;;;;;;;;;Seizure disorders;;;;;;;;;;History of organ transplantation;;;;;;;;;;Surgery within the last 12 months;;;;;;;;;;Positive tests for HIV, hepatitis B or C.

The benefit of drug treatment of hypertension to prevent major cardiovascular events was      consistently demonstrated in a large series of clinical trials controlled by placebo.      Diuretics are at least as efficacious as other blood pressure-lowering drugs, are well      tolerated, have longer duration of action and the advantage of very low cost to be used in a      population intervention.

Although half of these subjects with high blood pressure are still in the      pre-hypertensive stage (systolic blood pressure values in the 120-139 mmHg range or diastolic      blood pressure in the 80-89 mmHg range), the rate of progression to hypertension is high      (10-20% per year), according to studies done in other settings. The main objective of this      proposal is to evaluate the effectiveness of an affordable and sustainable primary health      care intervention to reduce blood pressure and prevent progression from pre-hypertensive      status to hypertension in individuals at poor urban clinics in Argentina, Guatemala, and      Peru. Our primary hypotheses are that pre-hypertensive subjects who receive mHealth (mobile      health) support for 12 months (intervention group) will have lower blood pressure compared to      individuals who receive the usual primary health care (control group); and that      pre-hypertensive subjects will maintain lower blood pressure six months after receiving      mHealth support. The investigators will determine the effects of an intervention using      mHealth technology, including short message services (SMS) and one-to-one telephone calls, to      promote lifestyle modification focused on reducing blood pressure among participants. The      intervention also aims to help participants become better informed, motivated, and encouraged      to practice self-management of their own health; to improve patient satisfaction levels;      provide tailored targeted interventions; and to improve patient-provider relationships. The      proposal is designed as a proof-of-concept intervention in three Latin American countries      that encompass a wide range of environments and health care settings. A total of 212 subjects      (30-60 years old) per country will be recruited in primary health clinics and randomized to      study groups.

Diabetic nephropathy is a clinical      syndrome characterized by persistent albuminuria (> 300 mg/d or > 200 mcg/min) that is      confirmed on at least 2 occasions 3 to 6 months apart, a relentless decline in the glomerular      filtration rate (GFR), and elevated arterial blood pressure. In addition to the renal      hemodynamic alterations, patients with overt diabetic nephropathy (dipstick-positive      proteinuria and decreasing GFR) generally develop systemic hypertension. Hypertension is an      adverse factor in all progressive renal diseases and seems especially so in diabetic      nephropathy. The deleterious effects of hypertension are likely directed at the vasculature      and microvasculature. Use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or      angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), strict glycemic control and use of antilipidemic drugs      may improve progression of DN.      TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK, TNFSF12) is a member of the TNF superfamily of      structurally related cytokines. The human TWEAK gene encodes a 249-amino acid type II      transmembrane glycoprotein (30 kD). TWEAK may be expressed as a full-length, membrane-bound      protein and as a 156-amino acid, 18-kD soluble protein, (sTWEAK) that results from      proteolysis of TWEAK. TWEAK gene is expressed in many tissues, including brain, kidney,      heart, arterial wall, monocytes and macrophages. Reduced soluble TNF-like weak inducer of      apoptosis (sTWEAK) plasma levels have been reported both in patients with subclinical      atherosclerosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD).      Long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a multimeric inflammatory mediator. Increased serum PTX3 levels      have been reported among end-stage renal disease patients. Moreover, PTX3 has been suggested      to represent a novel mortality risk factor, and elevated PTX3 levels have been shown to      accompany increased albuminuria among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).      There is no data about the effects of Renin angiotensin system blockage (RAS), calcium      channel blocker and combined drugs on TWEAK and PTX3 levels in diabetic proteinuric patients      with hypertension. The aim of this study was to find out whether the beneficial effects of      RAS blockage, calcium channel blocker and combined drugs in diabetic hypertensive proteinuric      patients has any relation with the alteration of TWEAK and PTX3 levels. The investigators      searched for the effects of angiotensin II (AII) receptor blocker (Valsartan 160 mg), calcium      channel blocker (Amlodipine 10 mg) and AII receptor blocker plus calcium channel blocker      (Valsartan 160 mg + Amlodipine 10 mg) on the clinical and laboratory parameters of diabetic      hypertensive proteinuric patients.",TWEAK;FMD;PTX3;Valsartan;Amlodipine;Renin Angiotensin System;,"Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;Male Urogenital Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications;",C0006684;C0020538;C0003018;C1706968;C0241863;C0373719;C0013227;C0814183;C1550655;C0033687;C2946261,C0006684;C0020538;C0003018;C1706968;C0241863;C0373719;C0013227;C0814183;C1550655;C0033687;C2946261,C0022661;C1272641;C0022661;C0006684;C0006684;C0020538;C0011881;C0011881;C0011881;C0011849;C0004153;C0870261;C0870261;C0022658;C0022658;C0022658;C0003009;C0009566;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0857121;C0857121;C0001925;C4281788;C0033687;C0022658;C0003018;C0003018;C0242656;C0035648;C0001925;C0003018;C0442797;C0051696;C0750484;C0216784;C0216784;C0039082;C0441090;C1446409;C0241863;C0700287;C0127400;C0700287;C0241863;C0241863;C0241863;C0006675;C0006675;C3245511;C0332148;C0022646;C0032105;C0022646;C0013227;C0814183;C0814183;C0814183;C0814183;C0814183;C0006104;C0018787;C0229671;C0679622;C0373719;C0013227;C0814183;C0947630;C0013227;C0814183;C0022661;C3714552;C0870814;C3714552;C3245479;C0017654;C0017654;C2350571;C0017654;C1979715;C0507850;C0233492;C0184511;C0072522;C1294065;C0033687;C0033687;C0033687;C1518681;C0233492;C1518681;C1518681;C1518681;C1979715;C1979715;C0022885;C0442743;C3839460;C0076106;C4084912;C1524094;C0200637;C0856882;C0856882;C1561542;C0814183;C0814183;C1328018;C0150312;C3272565;C4522152;C0244399;C1706968;C1706968;C3272565;C2363670;C0033621;C0033621;C1854293;C0210233;C0546816;C1295665;C0151576,,C0010054;C0020538;C0033687;C0003018;C0241863;C0262926;C0337664;C4085652;C1300072;C0360714,C0003018,20090501,,,Completed,20430947,17,17.0,0.0029098141285340004,0.003492529872318,CKD stage 1 patients;;;;;;;;;;Older than 18 years of age;;;;;;;;;;Type 2 Diabetic patients;;;;;;;;;;Proteinuria;;;;;;;;;;Hypertension,History of coronary artery disease;;;;;;;;;;Smokers;;;;;;;;;;Taking statins or renin-angiotensin blockers

Since      hyperglycaemia and hypertension are key risk factors for both micro- and macrovascular      complications, assessment of both glucose and BP lowering effects of empagliflozin in      hypertensive African American patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus could provide clinically      highly relevant, new information for the use of empagliflozin.      Essential hypertension is four times more common in African Americans than in Caucasians.      One of the risk factors for hypertension is sodium sensitivity and approximately one third of      the essential hypertensive population is responsive to sodium intake. There is a higher      association of hypertension with sodium sensitivity in African American patients with type 2      Diabetes Mellitus.

People ≥25 years of age and who are listed in the voter      list 2006 of Electoral Commission of Nepal who were either hypertensive, pre-hypertensive or      normotensive are eligible for eligible for participation in the study. A computer generated      random codes will be used to divide clusters into treatment and control arm. FCHVs will      conduct family based health education and blood pressure measurements in the treatment arm vs      not any interventions in control arm. Independent assessors will conduct the baseline and end      line assessment of the intervention. Intention to treat analysis and per protocol analysis      will be used in analysis to detect significant differences between treatment and control      group participants at baseline and follow up. Student t-tests for normally distributed      variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables will be used. In the event that      randomization do not control for differences between the treatment and control groups on      baseline characteristics, the investigators will statistically control for those differences      in subsequent analysis of program effects. The final outcome will be modeled by using      multiple linear regressions analysis. The investigators hope that if the intervention      outcomes shows positive effects in treatment arm, this approach can be adopted into the      existing health care delivery system in Nepal. Assessing the FCHVs' ability may further      contribute to developing a policy that can be scaled-up to a national level. The lessons      learned from this project may also be replicated in rural areas and similar settings      elsewhere in the world.",,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0020538;C0376636,C1096777;C0005823;C0184661;C1293152;C0442711;C1555715,C0007222;C0011211;C0005823;C0886296;C0020538;C0020538;C0857121;C0857121;C2712122;C0184661;C0184661;C1299583;C0684320;C0031809;C0424927;C0087111;C0424927;C0087111;C0162425;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0442711;C1446409;C0425382;C0023185;C1552826;C1301584;C1301584;C0442726;C1552839;C0242456;C0947630;C0392366;C0392366;C0240919;C1273517;C1273517;C1273517;C0392347;C1550472;C0446516;C0446516;C0446516;C0446516;C1704632;C0542559;C1518681;C1518681;C0086034;C0011164;C0022396;C0175659;C0018792;C1552839;C0596948;C0085632;C0596948;C0085632;C0596948;C0085632;C0430179;C0728774;C0728774;C0728774;C3854058;C1541375,C0020538,C1096775;C0549206;C0205082;C0549206;C0205082;C0038951;C0947630;C0947630;C1561543;C0599880;C1561543;C0231218;C4522138;C0728774,C1140111,20170201,,,Completed,29241617;27316539,7,3.5,0.004575491541559,0.003420140105328,"People ΓëÍ25 years of age and who are listed in the voter list of 2006 and those             participated in our prevalence study are eligible for inclusion in the baseline             survey. - Person who give consent to participate in our intervention study,;;;;;;;;;;does not have any plan to migrate from Lekhnath Municipality for at least 1 year,;;;;;;;;;;non-pregnant women and;;;;;;;;;;personal who are not severely ill will be included as eligible participants.",No consent;;;;;;;;;;Pregnant women;;;;;;;;;;Severely Il;;;;;;;;;;Plan for migration for the study municipality within 1 year

Lifestyle      counseling is recommended as a first line therapy for reducing blood pressure (BP) and risk      for cardiovascular events. Recent studies suggest that e-based lifestyle interventions are      effective in evoking therapeutic change in BP1. However, BP response and adherence to      exercise and diet behavior varies significantly after e-based interventions due to variations      in treatment methodologies. Consensus is not yet established for a standardized e-counseling      protocol for hypertension. As noted in our systematic review, the two dominant models of      e-counseling procedures are expert-driven (protocol driven, prescriptive) and user-driven      (self-guided, collaborative). Expert-driven programs prescribe specific changes for lifestyle      behavior which are intended to facilitate compliance to behavioral change. In contrast, the      user-driven method actively involves the subject in goal-setting and/or the selection of the      intervention used to reach the behavioral goal. One conclusion from the systematic review is      that these models are used indiscriminately in e-counseling programs. There is currently      inadequate data to determine the efficacy of programs that are expert-driven vs. user-driven      in reducing BP while modifying lifestyle behaviour. It is possible that a combination of      expert-driven and user-driven features for lifestyle e-counseling is most effective. However,      before these two approaches can be combined, it is essential to establish the strengths and      limitations of each model.",,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C4553491;C1273869;C0020538;C0013126;C1564718,C4553491;C1273869;C0020538;C0013126;C1564718,C0007222;C1320716;C1955832;C1955832;C0005823;C0886296;C0886296;C0020538;C0020538;C0184661;C0035648;C0010210;C0010210;C0010210;C0010210;C0010210;C0087111;C1704632;C0442711;C0442711;C1552740;C1551357;C0332149;C0087111;C0947630;C0542559;C0025663;C3161035;C1551994;C0018017;C1273517;C0018017;C1273517;C3245479;C0087111;C3539181;C0184661;C0278329;C0677505;C0452240;C0677505;C0677505;C0233514;C0029939;C3714738;C2986890;C0301572;C0449900;C3161035;C0013126;C0013126;C0013126;C0013126;C0013126;C3161035;C0013126;C0013126;C0013126;C0013126;C1328018;C0678257;C0042070;C0042070;C0042070;C4698129;C4082977,C0020538,C0684167;C0004936;C0003364;C1510472;C0022658;C0033080;C0037315;C1516879;C0278329;C0013227;C0442739;C0011900;C0033975;C0032961;C3245501;C0001962;C1561543;C1306620;C1305849;C1518681;C4699604;C1522411;C1328018,C1140111,20150601,,,Completed,29456025,1,1.0,0.002639438458002,0.0033748356915980003,"Unchanged prescription for anti-hypertensive medication at least 2 months before             enrollment.;;;;;;;;;;Participants prescribed antihypertensive medication were also required to have SBP             ΓëÍ130 mmHg and/or DBP ΓëÍ85 mmHg, in order to prevent ""floor effects"".","Diagnosis of kidney disease, major psychiatric illness (e.g. psychosis), alcohol or             drug dependence in the previous year, pregnancy and sleep apnea.

The study will be a randomised placebo-controlled      double-blind crossover comparison of an α-blocker (α), β-blocker (β), and K+-sparing diuretic      (∆).      Patients will have a BP at entry above target on ABPM or home monitoring despite supervised      administration of maximum tolerated doses of A+C+D. Over 48 weeks they will then receive, in      random order either placebo or two doses each of doxazosin (α), bisoprolol (β) or      spironolactone (∆).

This hypothesis is supported by four proven findings:        1. -sleep apnea is an independent risk factor for arterial hypertension (1).        2. -The greater the number of RSD, the greater the loss of control over blood-pressure           levels (1).        3. -The prevalence of sleep apnea in patients with AHT refractory to treatment is very high           (11,12).        4. -Treatment of patients with sleep apnea and AHT-r with CPAP succeeds in significantly           reducing blood-pressure levels in the only (small-scale) studies undertaken to date           (14,15).      4.

Secondary objectives:        -  To evaluate the effect of treatment with CPAP on the various elements assessed in BP           (systolic/diastolic; daytime/nighttime, etc) and the circadian profile           (dipper/non-dipper/raiser patterns; variability and homogeneity of blood-pressure           levels, etc) obtained during a 24-hour out-patient study (AMPA).        -  To analyze the related variables or subgroups of patients most affected by treatment           with CPAP.        -  To evaluate the effect of CPAP on the levels of some of the biological variables           involved in the pathogenesis of AHT-r (renin, angiotensin, aldosterone, atrial           natriuretic factor, etc).",Sleep apnea;Refractory Hypertension;Difficult-to-treat hypertension;CPAP;,Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Respiratory Tract Diseases;,C0199451;C0020538;C0087111;C1564718,C0020538;C0087111;C1564718,C0020538;C0699748;C0037315;C1290940;C0035648;C0037315;C0037315;C0003018;C0002006;C0597421;C4551656;C0018017;C0018017;C0087111;C0087111;C0442804;C0018017;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0460139;C0460139;C0460139;C0460139;C0460139;C0150312;C0947630;C3540008;C0700164;C1518681;C1518681;C0655359;C1518681;C0018792;C0947630;C0005767;C0003578;C0005767;C0005767;C0175659;C0005767;C0005767;C0947630;C0051318;C0087111;C0037088;C0233492;C0234451;C1548762;C0027627;C0012000;C0220825;C0220825;C1995642;C0220825;C1550518;C0332535,C0039082;C0003578,C0516906;C0018801;C1320716;C1565489;C0162701;C0034072;C0086045;C0857121;C0917799;C0037315;C0001973;C0001617;C0011900;C1519316;C0032961;C0087111;C0027627;C0683278;C0443343;C0001962;C0034869;C0022646;C1561542;C0947630;C0947630;C1561538;C0231221;C1550655;C1552867;C0033213;C1550655;C1550655;C1550655;C0009797;C0018824;C1947907;C3714738;C0201975;C4331837;C1571886;C0332155,C0037313,20120201,,,Completed,26314530;24327037,98,49.0,0.0031828189502600005,0.0033077519819240003,Patients aged 18-75 with a diagnosis of primary AHT-r and an AHI ΓëÍ15.;;;;;;;;;;Signature indicating informed consent.,"Those patients with, in the opinion of the researcher, incapacitating hypersomnia will             be excluded (to avoid the ethical problems associated with not treating a symptomatic             sleep apnea patient).;;;;;;;;;;Patients with risky professions or work involving dangerous goods.;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;The regular use of psychotropic drugs that could significantly modify the results of             the sleep studies, or previous alcoholism (more than 100 gr of alcohol/day).;;;;;;;;;;Patients previously treated with CPAP.;;;;;;;;;;Record of poor compliance with anti-hypertensive treatment.;;;;;;;;;;AHT secondary to cardiac insufficiency, valvulopathy, renal or endocrinological             causes, cor pulmonale or the consumption of oral corticoids, or any other known cause.;;;;;;;;;;Patients who have suffered from a cardiovascular event in the month prior to inclusion             in the study, or patients who were unstable at the time of their inclusion in the             study.;;;;;;;;;;Known renal insufficiency with a concentration of creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dl"

The purpose of      the proposed project is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of an ePHR that      has been modified using a patient- and family-centered approach and incorporates the      experiences, perspectives, and insights of patients and family members actually using the      system. Comparison of patients with the ePHR intervention to a group of ""care as usual""      patients will be performed. The investigators Specific Aims are: (1) To improve the      application of patient- and family-centered care elements in an existing ePHR, based on      feedback from a pilot study of patients and their families. The modified ePHR will be tested      in a pilot group of patients with hypertension and their families. (2) To implement and test      the effectiveness of the modified ePHR with patients being treated for hypertension by a team      of physicians, mid-level practitioners, nurse clinicians, and support staff in two ambulatory      settings. Outcome measures will include patient activation and perception of care,      quantifiable biological markers, patient-physician communication, and congruence of treatment      with guidelines, particularly medication management; (3) To monitor the shift in provider and      support staff awareness and incorporation of patient- and family-centered care as a result of      implementation of the ePHR using questionnaires and focus groups.

The program helps patients monitor their own BP and      medication and keeps nurses,physicians and pharmacists informed while respecting patient      confidentiality. The IT system links directly with the patient's pharmacy data. Using      pharmacy data and responses to questions on compliance and BP control, the IT system provides      appropriate counselling, telephone reminders, generates prescription refill and renewal      reminder calls and monitors BP. The system reports compliance and self recorded BP      measurements to healthcare providers and also links with a nurse. This is so that the nurse,      the patient's doctor and pharmacist can help answer questions about medication and      controlling high blood pressure.      A total of 500 patients in Laval, Quebec will participate in the study. Half of the patients      will have the program plus usual care and the other have usual care only. We hypothesize that      the program will improve BP control by helping patients take their medication properly and by      helping doctors ensure that the best strength and kinds of medication are used to control      high blood pressure. We believe the program will achieve this by helping to improve      communication between patients and healthcare providers, without adversely impacting quality      of life. Additional sub-studies will determine if the program is cost effective and can be      applied in real practice and if the program helps patients, doctors, pharmacists and nurses      communicate better.","randomised prospective trial;medication refill compliance;hypertension;ambulatory blood pressure monitoring;information technology based patient support system;process of care, quality of life, pharmacoeconomics;multidisciplinary patient management;",Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0020538;C0086388;C1171411;C0376691;C1550655;C1571886,C0683867;C0005823;C0033137;C0376691;C0947630;C1171411;C1564718,C0683867;C0149761;C0020538;C0020538;C0508431;C1571886;C0010210;C0566001;C0086388;C0013227;C0086388;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C0086388;C0460139;C3244303;C3244303;C0181904;C0237607;C0030695;C0684224;C0947630;C0947630;C0005767;C0947630;C3245479;C3245479;C1551994;C1552861;C1273517;C1704632;C1555587;C1555587;C0184511;C0184511;C4693928;C0282440;C3714738;C3714738;C0011164;C1547595;C1515258;C0562357;C0220825;C1555587;C0557033;C0182913;C4082977,C0020538,C0694539;C0514044;C0003364;C0013216;C1096775;C1096775;C0020538;C0033137;C0566001;C1547135;C0013227;C0332155;C0199230;C0012634;C3244303;C3244303;C0750558;C0549206;C0542559;C0012634;C1299582;C0595998;C3641827;C0947630;C0947630;C1512346;C0947630;C1114365;C0009797;C2911690;C1515258;C0332534;C4699604;C4283785;C0728774;C0332155,C0518214;C0005823;C0376636,20070601,,,Unknown status,20031834,17,17.0,0.0029671405296910003,0.0032434384025709995,Male or female with untreated or suboptimally controlled hypertension;;;;;;;;;;Age equal to or greater than 18 years;;;;;;;;;;Ambulatory outpatients currently being treated in primary care setting;;;;;;;;;;Capable of giving informed consent;;;;;;;;;;Able to communicate in and read either French or English;;;;;;;;;;Purchase their medication at a pharmacy participating in the program;;;;;;;;;;Agree to stay with one pharmacy for the duration of the study;;;;;;;;;;Able to have a 24 hour ABPM recording within 7 days of screening;;;;;;;;;;Written informed consent obtained,Unlikely to complete study due to life-threatening disease or condition;;;;;;;;;;Having chronic atrial fibrillation;;;;;;;;;;Unable to use an ordinary telephone;;;;;;;;;;Pregnant at the initial visit;;;;;;;;;;Participating in another clinical trial concomitantly;;;;;;;;;;Participated in an antihypertensive clinical trial within the past 2 months;;;;;;;;;;Living with another subject that is currently participating in the study;;;;;;;;;;Delaying pharmacotherapy for baseline ABPM could put the subject at risk.

One in four adults in Singapore has hypertension. We propose a      pilot study in 2 polyclinics in Singapore, 1 deliver a structured multi-component      intervention and another usual care. A total of 100 adults with uncontrolled high blood      pressure will be followed for 3 months. The intervention includes 1) algorithm-driven      antihypertensive treatment for all patients using fixed-dose combination and lipid lowering      for high risk patients, 2) motivational conversation for high risk patients; and 3) telephone      based follow-ups of all patients by a team of physician supervised nurse practitioners and      nurses. The change in BP will be compared between intervention and control groups. The      structured care including the above mentioned components is likely to be more effective than      usual care in lowering BP levels of patients with uncontrolled high blood pressure.

NCT00119054,0,Effectiveness of Home-Based Health Messaging for Patients With Hypertension and Diabetes,Effectiveness of Care Coordination in Managing Medically Complex Patients,Diabetes Mellitus;Hypertension;,,Inclusion Criteria:        Patients must obtain their primary care at the Iowa City VAMC and have been diagnosed with        Diabetes Mellitus and hypertension. Must be cognitively intact and have a telephone line in        the home.        Exclusion Criteria:        Patients with corrected vision worse than 20/40 or cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental Status        Exam score of 17 or less) will not be eligible.,"Patients treated at Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers are older and have multiple chronic      conditions. Two of the most common conditions in the VA population are hypertension (HTN) and      Type 2 diabetes (DM). Unfortunately, DM and HTN have few perceptible symptoms on a daily      basis that motivate patients to comply with treatment recommendations and lifestyle changes.      Thus, serious complications and long-term adverse outcomes are common in both of these      conditions.      Home telehealth is a general term used to describe the delivery of health care services to      the patient's home using audio, video, or other telecommunications technologies. Although      home telehealth offers a number of theoretical advantages, few well-designed controlled      clinical trials have been conducted to establish efficacy and cost benefit. Furthermore,      projects to date have focused on special populations, e.g., heart failure or mental      illnesses. Since home telehealth may hold the most promise for individuals dealing with      multiple chronic illnesses, there is a need for population-based studies addressing the needs      of patients in primary care settings.      Care coordination, as defined by the VHA Office of Care Coordination, is a process of      assessment and ongoing monitoring of patients using home telehealth to proactively enable      prevention, investigation, and treatment that enhances the health of patients and prevents      unnecessary and inappropriate use of resources. Care coordination embeds technology into a      care management process. This results in the right care, at the right time, in the right      place.",Hypertension;Diabetes Mellitus;Telemedicine;Nursing Care;,Endocrine System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases;,C4553491;C0020538;C0011847;C1548341;C1550655;C1328956,C4553491;C1550655;C0199168;C0939261,C0011211;C0008679;C0011860;C1096775;C0009566;C0018801;C1552578;C0020538;C0278060;C0033137;C1328956;C1328956;C1328956;C0031809;C0150369;C1328956;C0199176;C0376636;C0087111;C0221423;C0087111;C0947630;C3245511;C0725694;C3245511;C0229992;C0562342;C1548341;C1273517;C0012634;C0012634;C0012634;C0520966;C0520966;C1550655;C1457887;C0542559;C4684637;C2911690;C0028079;C0013119;C1555709;C0015726;C0015726;C0683867;C0021141;C0449416;C1704289;C0332155;C0701928,C0011847,C0338656;C0011849;C0033137;C0020538;C0011900;C0042789;C1457868;C3262831;C0582103;C1550655;C1550655;C2328206;C0723443;C1515258;C3534109;C3843408,,20071201,,,Completed,23356382;21476945,41,20.5,0.003021943916127,0.003182251897535,Patients must obtain their primary care at the Iowa City VAMC and have been diagnosed with        Diabetes Mellitus and hypertension.

Symptoms include breathlessness, poor exercise capacity and reduced      quality of life.      In many other serious heart or lung diseases it has been shown that physical rehabilitation      improves patient's fitness and quality of life. In PAH there are no clear guidelines and in      general physical activity has traditionally been discouraged, although evidence for this      advice is lacking. Interesting research project in Germany showed significant benefit for      in-patient rehabilitation in PAH patients.

Hypertension is estimated to account for 1 in 8      deaths in the world, and in the US the direct and indirect costs of high BP are estimated to      reach $59.7 billion in 2005. JNC-7 guidelines recommend lifestyle modifications for      prehypertension, followed by antihypertensive medication if BP progresses to Stage I      hypertension. Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an increasingly popular practice      that has been purported to alleviate stress and treat certain health conditions. Some stress      management therapies and one meditation therapy (e.g., Transcendental Meditation) have shown      promise in reducing elevated BP, but MBSR has not been evaluated as a treatment for high BP.      When added to lifestyle modification advice, MBSR may be an appropriate complementary      treatment for prehypertension. However, prior to a large randomized clinical trial of MBSR      for prehypertension and/or hypertension, pilot data is necessary to provide preliminary      evidence of a treatment effect and to evaluate feasibility. This feasibility randomized      clinical trial of MBSR for unmedicated prehypertension will provide preliminary evidence to      support a larger randomized clinical trial by evaluating the feasibility and safety of MBSR      as a complementary treatment for high BP and by documenting any treatment effect. Sixty      patients with unmedicated BP in the range of SBP 120-139 mm Hg or DBP 80-89 mm Hg will be      randomly assigned to MBSR or a progressive muscle relaxation control condition. All patients      will receive lifestyle modification advice. Patients will complete 8 weeks of MBSR delivered      in a group format by an experienced psychologist trained in MBSR or 8 weeks of progressive      muscle relaxation training matched for therapist contact and homework. Patients BP will be      assessed prior to randomization and following treatment by researchers blind to treatment      assignment. Accrual rates, acceptance of randomization, treatment adherence, treatment      fidelity, and patient satisfaction with treatment will be evaluated.",,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0020538;C3542996;C1293152;C0038435,C0020538;C3542996;C1293152;C0038435,C0004361;C0150814;C0206034;C0206034;C0020538;C0282333;C0814263;C0003364;C1518681;C1518681;C1096775;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0242428;C3542996;C1301725;C0162791;C0013227;C0376636;C1293152;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0012634;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0237607;C1552601;C3245509;C0011065;C3244286;C0038435;C0038435;C0038435;C0150600;C0150600;C1301627;C1300072;C0456909;C3245479;C1306620;C1305849;C1306620;C1305849;C0237607;C2707291;C1696708;C1696708;C1696708;C1696708;C1550655;C1550655;C1555587;C1555587;C0080194;C3840684;C3840684;C0497247;C3840684;C1716046;C1716046;C3839460;C0220825;C0220825;C0776963;C4331837;C2702329;C1552839;C4331837;C0729829;C0308779;C0220825;C4283785;C0087130;C4698129;C0015730,C0020538,C0003364;C0020538;C0013227;C0032961;C1553386;C1696708,C1140111,20100501,,,Unknown status,24127622,22,22.0,0.002754177015762,0.003082183299345,prehypertension;;;;;;;;;;30-60 years of age,normal BP;;;;;;;;;;hypertension;;;;;;;;;;pregnancy;;;;;;;;;;smoking;;;;;;;;;;use of antihypertensive medication

Despite a heavy burden of hypertension (33% of all persons aged      45 years and over), there are no reliable data on comparative strategies to manage      hypertension in Pakistan. Our Wellcome Trust funded pilot study in Karachi, Pakistan on 320      adults aged 40 years and over showed that the prevalence of hypertension (95% CI) was 40.3%      (34.9-45.7%), and CVD was 32.5% (27.6-37.8%).      We will now conduct a study with two components: 1) cross sectional study to determine the      prevalence of CVD, and its determinants in Karachi, Pakistan; and 2) prospective, 2x2      factorial design, cluster allocation intervention study to evaluate the impact of a i)      Population approach of household health education (HHE) by community health workers (CHW) on      BP levels of population aged 5 years or over in low-middle income communities of Karachi; and      ii) High-Risk approach of special BP management administered by intensively trained local      general practitioners on BP levels of hypertensive subjects aged > = 40 years from the above      population.      The cost effective BP control strategy would serve as a model for a much-needed national      level hypertension control programme in Pakistan, and possibly other developing countries in      South Asia.      We hypothesize that 1) HHE delivered by trained CHW is superior to no HHE in lowering BP      levels of the population; and 2) management of hypertension by specially trained GPs is      better than usual care provided in the communities of Karachi in lowering blood pressure of      hypertensive subjects.",,Male Urogenital Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications;,C0020538;C0679199;C1564718,C1140111,C0007222;C0020538;C1096775;C0005823;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0857121;C0020538;C0020538;C0857121;C0035648;C0679199;C0376636;C0376636;C0424927;C3858758;C0679199;C3245511;C1552826;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C3161035;C3245479;C4321237;C1550472;C3843172;C4699619;C4699619;C1820370;C1820370;C2735418;C0080194;C0080194;C0080194;C0086034;C1555588;C2735115;C1552858;C0308779;C0220825;C3854058;C0332149;C3842265;C0701928;C4082977,C3887460;C0012634,C1275743;C0032961;C0205082;C1299582;C0009797;C3842265,C1140111,20070901,,,Unknown status,26540210;21509050;20530082;19884620;17646192,103,20.6,0.0033574483460390003,0.003057106597117,All subjects aged 5 years or over residing in randomly selected communities,Those who have severe co-morbid conditions;;;;;;;;;;Pregnancy;;;;;;;;;;Unable to give informed consent

Methods 4a. Overview The study will be conducted in participants in the African-American      Study of Kidney Disease (AASK) Cohort study as a randomized three period cross-over trial.      Eighty five percent of AASK cohort participants are currently on an ACE inhibitor or      angiotensin receptor blocker; the most commonly used ACE inhibitor is ramipril. The new      strategies proposed in this pilot study will remain ramipril-based, to maintain the overall      blood pressure control achieved thus far.      The antihypertensive regimens proposed are as follows:        -  AM dosing of ramipril and other once daily medications in the participants           antihypertensive regimen (termed USUAL),        -  Bedtime dosing of ramipril and other once a day medications in the participant's           antihypertensive regimen (termed HS-DOSING), and        -  their current antihypertensive regimen plus an additional antihypertensive agent dosed           at bed time; the choice of the additional agent will be tailored based on prespecified           clinical guidelines (termed ADD-ON DOSING)      The ""usual arm"" serves as the comparator arm. The ""hs dosing"" and ""add-on dosing"" arms test      practical strategies that could be tested in a subsequent clinical outcomes trial and that      could be implemented in clinical practice. We hypothesize that both arms will reduce      nocturnal BP in comparison to ""usual dosing"". We further hypothesize that the ""hs dosing"" arm      will raise daytime BP somewhat but have no net effect on 24 hour BP and that the ""add on      dosing"" arm will have no effect on daytime BP but lower 24 hour BP.      This pilot study will begin after the last scheduled AASK Cohort study visit. Eligible      participants will be treated for 6 weeks on each of 3 antihypertensive regimens.

The HBP crisis is particularly onerous to African Americans      as they are disproportionately more susceptible to HBP than non-Hispanic White Americans.      Poor adherence to prescribed medication regimens is a major problem, as only about half of      patients who have been diagnosed with hypertension adhere to prescribed medications. Mobile      phones and text messages are becoming widely integrated into routine daily life and may offer      a simple and non-labor intensive strategy for improving the quality of medication management      through enhancing medication adherence. This proposed research will be conducted in two      distinct phases addressing three specific aims. For Specific Aim 1 (Phase I), the      investigators propose to conduct focus groups with participants from the investigators target      population in order to obtain feedback to guide the development of a mobile phone text      message system that seeks to improve adherence to antihypertensive medications. For Specific      Aim 2 (Phase II), the investigators propose to pilot test the newly developed text message      intervention with a randomized controlled trial. For Specific Aim 3 (Phase II), the      investigators propose to ascertain participant perceptions of intervention effectiveness and      satisfaction in order to guide further system refinement. In Phase I, African Americans with      uncontrolled hypertension (n=24-32) will be recruited to take part in one of four focus      groups that will help guide the development of the text message intervention. In Phase II,      African Americans with uncontrolled hypertension will be randomized to receive usual care      (n=30) vs. the text message intervention (n=30). The primary outcome in this pilot will be      change in medication adherence at one month follow-up; secondary outcomes include change in      medication self-efficacy and systolic and diastolic blood pressure at one month follow-up, as      well as participant satisfaction with the text message intervention. The proposed research      will utilize the Wayne State University (WSU) Center for Urban Studies to conduct high      quality and professionally run focus groups, the WSU Division of Computing and Information      Technology's Broadcast Message Service infrastructure for the delivery of text messages, the      WSU Center for Health Research for statistical analysis and grant management assistance, and      a diverse study team from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds at WSU.

The effectiveness of non-drug interventions to prevent      hypertension is low in the long term. It may be hypothesized that a population-based drug      intervention could reduce relevantly the burden of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.      Diuretics are at least as efficacious as other blood pressure-lowering drugs, are well      tolerated, have longer duration of action and the advantage of very low cost to be used in a      population intervention.

Subjects will be taken off all        antihypertensive OTC supplements and anti-cholesterol drugs for one week prior to study and        for the duration of the study. Women on birth control will remain on their regime. During        the time subjects receive no antihypertensive therapy, their blood pressure will be        monitored at least daily (either at home, in the clinic, or at another convenient        facility). If a subject's blood pressure exceeds 170/110 on three determinations over a        period of at least 15 minutes, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and appropriate        antihypertensive therapy resumed. In addition, if the subject's blood pressure exceeds        160/100 during measurements on three consecutive days, the subject will be withdrawn from        the study and appropriate antihypertensive therapy resumed.        EXCLUSION CRITERIA        Subjects will be excluded if they have diabetes, pregnancy, liver disease, pulmonary        disease, renal insufficiency, coronary heart disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular        disease, coagulopathy, actively smoked tobacco within last two years, in treatment for any        form of cancer, positive tests for HIV, hepatitis B or C, or take systemic corticosteroids.        These conditions are all known to adversely influence insulin sensitivity.        Subjects will be excluded if they have a history of malignant hypertension, aortic aneurysm        or stroke.        Subjects with known hypersensitivity to octafluoropropane or with known cardiac shunts will        also be excluded from participating because of potential adverse effects from microbubble        contrast agent.        Subjects will be excluded if they are unable to give informed consent for all procedures.        Children are excluded from this study because children are not typically hypertensive.","This study will examine whether dark chocolate affects the way patients with hypertension      (high blood pressure) respond to insulin, a hormone secreted by the pancreas that regulates      blood glucose (sugar) levels. In many people with hypertension, insulin is not as effective      in helping the body use glucose. This is called insulin resistance. Insulin also increases      blood flow into muscle by opening inactive blood vessels. Laboratory studies suggest that      eating dark chocolate may improve blood pressure. This study will determine whether dark      chocolate improves insulin resistance or changes how blood vessels react to insulin in      hypertensive people.      People between 21 and 65 years of age who have high blood pressure and are not pregnant may      be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical      examination, and blood and urine tests.      Participants refrain from eating foods containing chocolate or cocoa for 1 week and then come      to the clinic on three separate occasions 3 weeks apart for a glucose clamp test and contrast      ultrasound, described below. At the first glucose clamp test, subjects are randomly assigned      to drink either a cocoa drink with high anti-oxidant content or one with a very low content      of anti-oxidant. Each drink will be taken twice a day for 2 weeks. At the end of the 2 weeks,      they return for a second glucose clamp test. At the second test, they stop taking the cocoa      drink for 1 week and then start again for another 2 weeks. For this 2-week period, those who      were given the high anti-oxidant content cocoa drink the first 2 weeks will take the placebo,      very low anti-oxidant drink this time, and those who took the placebo will now have the high      anti-oxidant cocoa drink. After this 2 weeks of taking the cocoa drink or placebo, they then      take the third and last glucose clamp test.      Glucose clamp test: This test measures how the body responds to insulin. Subjects fast the      night before each test and do not eat until the test is over, usually in the early afternoon.      For the test, the subject lies in a bed or reclines in a chair.

Perception of      discrimination manifests itself as stereotype threat. We hypothesize that stereotype threat      impairs communication between minority patients and their physicians because of increased      stress and diminished trust, resulting in interactions that are less successful at enhancing      patient self-efficacy, in turn resulting in lower rates of adherence with anti-hypertensive      medication.      The intervention is a self-affirmation exercise performed prior to a patient-physician visit.      A similar intervention has been shown to reduce the racial gap in academic performance in      middle school classrooms.      We will explore the mechanistic effects of the intervention by analysis of audiotapes of      patient-provider visits following the intervention. We will measure the effect of the      intervention on minority hypertensive patients' adherence with antihypertensive medication      and blood pressure.      We will enroll 200 African American and Latino patients with hypertension and randomize 100      patients to perform the exercise and 100 patients to perform a null control exercise before      the visit. We will assess change in patient's adherence with antihypertensive medications and      in blood pressure over the six months following the index visit. In order to better      understand the effects of the intervention we will measure subject's mood following the      exercise, and self-reported stress levels, trust in the physician, and medication      self-efficacy following the visit. We will also assess the quality of the patient-provider      interaction from detailed analysis of audiotapes and from patient questionnaires. Following a      subsequent patient-physician visit, we will conduct telephone interviews with patients to      assess for persistence of any effects of the intervention.",,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0184661;C0020538;C0804815;C1550655;C0184511,C0184661;C0020538;C0804815;C1550655;C0184511,C0003364;C0003364;C0008679;C0012632;C0012632;C0005823;C0005823;C0034394;C0600564;C0600564;C0184661;C0857121;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0184661;C0857121;C0020538;C0184661;C0184661;C0013227;C0546816;C0030971;C0030971;C0038272;C0038272;C0013227;C0013227;C0162340;C0013227;C0018017;C3242376;C1555587;C0700287;C1555587;C0038435;C1552826;C1518681;C0038435;C1512346;C1512346;C0918012;C1512346;C1512346;C1512346;C0392366;C0541749;C1551994;C0026516;C1551994;C0935630;C0452240;C0452240;C0452240;C0452240;C0180799;C1518681;C1518681;C1518681;C1518681;C4693928;C0804815;C0804815;C0804815;C1515258;C1512346;C1561542;C0729829;C4331837;C1522411;C0151576;C4698129;C4698129;C4698129,C0020538,C0022661;C0031321;C0564216;C0020538;C0020538;C0011900;C0032961;C1883649;C0449416;C1551994;C1555587;C0009797;C0233492;C1328956;C1553821,C1140111,20111201,,,Completed,23128568,8,8.0,0.003136988471422,0.002840840525775,diagnosis of hypertension;;;;;;;;;;age > 21 years;;;;;;;;;;use of Denver Health as their usual source of care and pharmacy services;;;;;;;;;;self-described race/ethnicity of African American or Latino;;;;;;;;;;ability to provide informed consent,pregnancy-related hypertension;;;;;;;;;;end-stage renal disease;;;;;;;;;;unable to speak or write English at at least a 6th grade level.

There are no reports in the literature and concrete enough to elucidate      important issues, especially in the field of hypertension and pregnancy.      Searches based on current evidence concentrate their focus on the diagnosis of hypertensive      disorders and treatment of these diseases maternofetais repercussions. However, the prognosis      in the short and long term, as the BP outcome in mothers with severe preeclampsia, the most      effective treatment for the control of hypertensive crisis and metabolic and cardiovascular      events after two years of termination of pregnancy require further clarification.      The main idea for developing this research came from the clinical experience with the use of      captopril in Obstetric ICU IMIP. This drug has long been used in postpartum women with severe      preeclampsia or chronic hypertension exacerbated by pregnancy for control of hypertensive      crisis and keeping pressure levels. Following the technical standards of the institution and      during his administration, there were reports of side effects such as dry cough and nausea,      beyond the threshold dose of 150mg daily captopril was easily achieved hindering control the      use of hypotensive.      Alternative therapy, clonidine began to be used in mothers with some restriction on the use      of ACE inhibitors and its hypotensive effect for peak pressure was satisfactory. What is not      known yet is how long clonidine reduces high blood pressure and how long to leave stabilized      compared to the use of captopril.      There are no reports in the literature databases, no randomized clinical trials that prove      the effectiveness of clonidine for the treatment of hypotensive pressure peaks in this      particular group of patients, even in comparison with other classes of antihypertensive      drugs, especially captopril, to this purpose.      The investigators' primary assumption is that clonidine has better effectiveness in      decreasing the frequency of pressure peaks when compared with captopril.","captopril, clonidine, pregnancy-induced hypertension,;",Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications;Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0020538;C0009014;C0006938;C0087111,C0206034;C0020538;C4553491;C0009014;C0006938;C0087111,C0206034;C0392535;C0745114;C0341950;C0020546;C0020538;C0003364;C3887460;C1533734;C0003015;C4553491;C4553491;C0020538;C0857121;C0032914;C0857121;C0877248;C0436331;C0857353;C0857353;C0857353;C0023866;C0237607;C0184512;C0023866;C0442797;C0032961;C0032961;C0011900;C0012634;C0087111;C0033325;C0087111;C0006938;C0032961;C0038137;C0850149;C0006938;C0009014;C0009014;C0006938;C0242356;C0009014;C0087111;C0006938;C0009014;C0006938;C0012634;C0460139;C0460139;C0460139;C0460139;C0684224;C0684224;C0087111;C0684224;C0456387;C0025344;C0205082;C0231224;C0027497;C0332219;C1518681;C1300072;C1553496;C0013227;C0013227;C1273517;C1273517;C0587597;C3245501;C0030987;C1547307;C1880310;C1546848;C3539125;C3539125;C0376649;C4084912;C2707259;C2347273;C1328018;C1328018;C0700164;C0600116;C1552839;C0600116;C3272565,,C0341439;C0341439;C0020538;C1301624;C1301624;C0020517;C0020517;C0035078;C4281788;C0013227;C0037189;C0012634;C0032961;C0006938;C0009014;C1858460;C0018787;C0012634;C1548578;C0012634;C0013227;C0013227;C0013227;C1114365;C0857121,C0852036;C0006938;C0009014,20130601,,,Completed,28125624;23899372,3,1.5,0.003046483332491,0.0027923772750790003,Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy;;;;;;;;;;;Postpartum;;;;;;;;;;;Age 18 to 45 years;;;;;;;;;;;Very high blood pressure,"Cardiac disease;;;;;;;;;;;Smoking;;;;;;;;;;;Use of illicit drugs that may interfere with maternal hemodynamics;;;;;;;;;;;Contraindications to the use of captopril: renal failure, chronic liver disease and             hypersensitivity to the drug;;;;;;;;;;;Contraindications to the use of clonidine: sinus node disease, chronic liver disease             and hypersensitivity to the drug;;;;;;;;;;;Inability to receive postpartum oral medications"

It has a life expectancy similar to some cancers.      There is treatment available but there is no cure. We now know that PAH is associated with      weakness in the muscles in the legs, which contributes to the symptoms patients' experience.      Researchers believe that certain proteins found in high levels in the blood of patients with      other chronic diseases can affect muscle function and growth. One of these proteins is called      growth differentiating factor (GDF) 8, high levels of which are associated with muscle      weakness in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) and heart failure (HF). Interestingly      there are drugs available which block the actions of GDF-8 on muscle cells which has been      shown in animals to result in increased muscle size. A related protein called GDF-15 is found      in elevated levels in patients PAH, and is linked to prognosis. Our preliminary data suggests      that GDF-15 can also directly influence muscle size in a number of situations. We aim to      investigate the role of GDF-15 and related molecules in the development of muscle weakness in      patients with PAH. We will do this by measuring certain markers of muscle weakness and taking      blood and muscle samples in patients and controls. We will then compare the levels of GDF-15      in these tissues in those with and without muscle wasting. We hope this work will lead to a      greater understanding of the role of GDF-15 in the development of muscle weakness in patients      with PAH. GDF-15 levels may be important in allowing us to define which patients have muscle      weakness. In the future we aim to perform a clinical trial of drugs which block the actions      of GDF-15.",Muscle weakness;Pulmonary arterial hypertension;Transforming growth factor beta;Growth and differentiation factor 15;,"Nervous System Diseases;Cardiovascular Diseases;Respiratory Tract Diseases;Musculoskeletal Diseases;Pathological Conditions, Signs and Symptoms;",C0151786;C1510411;C0020538;C0678723;C2707265;C0003842;C0018270,C0151786;C1510411;C0020538;C0678723;C2707265;C0003842;C0018270,C2973725;C0008679;C0517929;C0030552;C0030552;C0030552;C0005823;C0026846;C1096775;C0018801;C0162340;C0243107;C0243107;C0237607;C0087111;C0024109;C0033325;C3714552;C3714552;C3714552;C0012634;C0005847;C0006826;C3540698;C0030054;C0001721;C0018270;C0018270;C4684637;C0005767;C0024109;C0005767;C0013227;C0028778;C0005767;C0013227;C0028778;C1140621;C3245479;C1704326;C0392347;C1442948;C1704326;C0581668;C1457887;C0233492;C0233492;C0005516;C0333166;C1716046;C3869883;C4084912;C0856882;C0011167;C1328018;C0026826;C1511938;C0087130;C0040597;C0033621;C0087130;C0040597,C2707265,C0020538;C0040128;C0558195;C0004083;C0271510;C0543488;C0024109;C0011849;C0012634;C0012634;C0018787;C1300072;C0392366;C2751993;C0452240;C1550655;C1550655;C1552867;C1552867;C0009488;C0018792,C1511938;C4083049;C0018270;C0003842,20160801,,,Terminated,30554141,0,0.0,0.002848122419749,0.002718392587156,Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension with New York Heart Association stage II;;;;;;;;;;III disease will be eligible for recruitment in the patient portion of the trial.

There is also accumulating evidence associating endothelial dysfunction,      which is defined as incapacity of the arteries to vasodilate when required, to elevated BP      and an increased risk of CVD.

Among the causes of      cardiovascular diseases are High Blood Pressure (HBP) and Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Type 2      diabetes (DM2) is associated with a twofold risk of cardiovascular disease, and endothelial      dysfunction is an early marker of vascular complications. There is evidence of action of      glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) on endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle. Vildagliptin      is a drug used in the treatment of DM2 able to prolong the activity of GLP-1, improving      glycemic control and endothelial function.

Furthermore      dysfunctional BMP signaling is a general feature of pulmonary hypertension even in      non-familial PAH.      We therefore hypothesized that increasing BMP signaling might prevent and reverse the      disease. We screened > 3500 FDA approved drugs for their propensity to increase BMP signaling      and found FK506 (Tacrolimus) to be a strong activator of BMP signaling. Tacrolimus restored      normal function of pulmonary artery endothelial cells, prevented and reversed experimental      PAH in mice and rats.      Given that Tacrolimus is already FDA approved with a known side-effect profile, it is an      ideal candidate drug to use in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.      The aims of our trial are:        1. Establish the Safety of FK506 in patients with PAH.        2. Evaluate the Efficacy of FK506 in PAH        3.

The reason is the lack      of opioid administration. Opioids easily cross placental barrier and negatively influence      newborn postpartum adaptation by respiratory depression. Introduction to GA is thus      accompanied by exaggerated autonomic stress reaction with hypertension and tachycardia. The      use of ultra-short acting opioid remifentanil should suppress stress response in mother      without increasing the risk for newborn. There are only a few clinical data available. This      study will be the first one systematically studying the influence of remifentanil in pregnant      women with hypertension on hemodynamic stability and newborns safety. This study will also      identify potential pharmacogenetic factors of individual variability in remifentanil response      with respect of drug efficacy and safety in mother and newborn.,remifentanil;Caesarean operation;general anaesthesia;hypertension;newborn's adaptation;pharmacogenetics;,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0002915;C0007876;C0246631;C0020538;C1550655,C0002915;C0007876;C0246631;C0020538;C1550655,C0235063;C0002915;C0149784;C0149784;C1533734;C1516606;C0020538;C0246631;C0246631;C0020538;C0246631;C0002903;C0039231;C4281788;C0000934;C0011209;C0011209;C0549206;C1704632;C0699809;C0242402;C1706912;C1551035;C1551035;C1551035;C0242402;C0332219;C0242402;C0728475;C0947630;C0947630;C0013227;C1551035;C1444783;C0205160;C0084688;C3858576;C1328018;C0221106;C2347500;C0332535,C0020538,C0002915;C1444662;C0246631;C0026751;C0020649;C0332218;C0549206;C3841297;C0011209;C0231303;C0011209;C0184898;C0011209;C0020517;C0242184;C0042149;C1305866;C1561540;C0009797;C0075414;C1552654,,20140801,,,Completed,25821405,0,0.0,0.00305261300284,0.002509118365332,"Pregnant women,;;;;;;;;;;age 18-45;;;;;;;;;;Cesarean delivery under general anesthesia;;;;;;;;;;informed consent",non-cooperative patient;;;;;;;;;;previous allergy to remifentanil or additional substance;;;;;;;;;;multiparity;;;;;;;;;;age of foetus <35th week;;;;;;;;;;estimated foetus weight <2500 g;;;;;;;;;;hypoxia or other signs of foetus distress;;;;;;;;;;mother's hypotension        Discontinuation Criteria:;;;;;;;;;;difficult foetus delivery (uterine incision-to-delivery interval >3 min)

Although these      two conditions can be detected much early in life and are amenable to interventions at      primary health care level, the health system in India fails to provide adequate interventions      at primary health care level which translates to huge burden of undiagnosed and uncontrolled      hypertension and diabetes in the community. This study aims to design a feasible and      sustainable evidence-based, decision support-enabled, health care delivery model for the      management of hypertension and diabetes in the primary health care facilities of Himachal      Pradesh.

For a mostly asymptomatic      disease, there is a huge challenge to maintain a good adherence and longtime persistence of      drug use so as to adequately control it. Even so, a significant proportion of patients will      develop resistant hypertension. In recent years, renal denervation has been argued as an      effective means to address blood pressure problem in several non-Chinese clinical trials. The      technique is to deliver low level radiofrequency energy through the renal artery wall to      target the sympathetic nervous system and then modulate blood pressure.      Shanghai WiseGain Medical Devices Co., LTD has developed the WiseGo Catheter System, which is      an irrigated radiofrequency ablation Catheter. With this Catheter, it is expected to improve      blood pressure status among patients with resistant hypertension failing polypharmacy.

The      cardiovascular responses in the cold could be different among hypertensive people because of      disturbances in the circulatory regulation or function, such as aortic stiffening and      increased vasomotor tone of peripheral arteries due to endothelial dysfunction associated      with the disease. To assess this, a controlled experiment employing a cold exposure similar      to everyday winter circumstances in a subarctic climate was performed.",Hypertension;Cold temperature;Blood pressure;Electrocardiography;,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C3887460;C0020538;C0009443;C1704632,C3887460;C0020538;C0009443;C1704632;C0274281,C0497247;C0856169;C0027051;C3887460;C0018801;C0005823;C3887460;C0231275;C0231275;C0857121;C0857121;C0220880;C0220880;C0557351;C0031843;C0003842;C0038454;C0018787;C0018787;C1556133;C0012634;C1552839;C0003483;C0009443;C0009443;C0009443;C1704632;C1704632;C0005775;C0233492;C1518681;C2911690;C1156284;C1156284;C4049938;C1136356;C0151576;C0151576,C0020538,C0010054;C0003364;C0003364;C0035243;C0857121;C0087111;C0087111;C0150312;C0012634;C1561540;C1561540;C0042497;C2911690;C1254545;C1552839;C4331837,,20111101,,,Completed,24983379,9,9.0,0.002740566913265,0.00233004386559,Measured BP (home measurements of one week) above 135/85 mmHg were selected to the             group of hypertensive subjects.;;;;;;;;;;Those with BP below 135/85 mmHg were selected as controls.,"Presence of coronary heart disease, respiratory diseases, and the use of             antihypertensive drug treatment.;;;;;;;;;;an average home BP ΓëÍ175/105 mmHg, initiating antihypertensive drug treatment, failed             home BP measurements, and having a respiratory infection within a week prior to the             controlled measurements"

The prevalence of hypertension, a major risk factor for CVD, is increasing over      time in sub-Saharan Africa, exerting a significant epidemiologic and economic burden on the      region. Without adequate control of hypertension, its health and economic burden will      increase drastically in the decades ahead. Well established and evidence-based interventions      to manage hypertension exist; however, treatment and control rates are low.      A critical component of hypertension management is to facilitate sustained access of affected      individuals to effective clinical services. In partnership with the Government of Kenya, the      United States Agency for International Development-Academic Model Providing Access to      Healthcare Partnership (AMPATH) is expanding its clinical scope of work in rural western      Kenya to include hypertension and other chronic diseases.      However, linking and retaining individuals with elevated blood pressure to the clinical care      program has been difficult. Thus, the overall objective of this application is to utilize a      multi-disciplinary implementation research approach to address the challenge of linking and      retaining hypertensive individuals to a hypertension management program. We aim to add to      existing knowledge on scalable and sustainable strategies for optimizing control of      hypertension and other chronic diseases in low- and middle-income countries.",linkage to care;hypertension management;behavioral science;cardiovascular health;global health;multi-disciplinary implementation research approach;linking and retaining;community health workers;CHWs;behavioral communication strategy;smartphone-based tool;electronic health record;retention to care;,Cardiovascular Diseases;,C0020538;C0035280;C0240919,C0020538;C0035280;C0240919,C0497247;C0007222;C0008679;C0008679;C0007465;C0886296;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0020538;C0857121;C0020538;C0020538;C0035648;C0678723;C0185125;C0376636;C0086388;C0376636;C0679199;C0087111;C0332218;C0018017;C0805586;C0376554;C0015264;C1442065;C1552826;C3161035;C0240919;C1550472;C0939276;C1144866;C0699910;C1524073;C0699530;C0729829;C0596948;C0221106;C1547298;C3272565;C1704289;C3242376;C3272565;C3272565,C0020538,C1697779;C0004268;C0392366;C0392366;C1306620;C1305849;C0231218;C3245501;C1555587;C0009797;C0497247;C1555709,C4693928,20170831,,,Completed,24767476,14,14.0,0.003215981027823,0.002177032692415,18 years old and older;;;;;;;;;;elevated BP (SBP > 140 or DBP >90),acutely ill and require immediate medical attention at the time of home-based testing;;;;;;;;;;individuals who do not provide informed consent during home-based testing
