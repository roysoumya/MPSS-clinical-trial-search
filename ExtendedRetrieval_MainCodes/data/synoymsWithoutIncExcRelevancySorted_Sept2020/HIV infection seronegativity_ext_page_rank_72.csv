NCT03571204,Combination Therapy With 3BNC117 and 10-1074 in HIV-Infected Individuals,"~     Background:~      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects the immune system. The main function of the immune~     system is protect you from infections and other diseases such as cancer. HIV attacks and~     cripples the immune system making people more susceptible to a variety of infections and~     cancers. Currently, the standard treatment for HIV infection is a daily administration of~     anti-HIV drugs. These drugs are called combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART is very~     effective at suppressing HIV, but does not cure HIV infection. ART must be taken continuously~     for life to be effective. ART can stop being effective if not taken correctly and can cause~     permanent side effects. Researchers want to see if two new products can control HIV infection~     without the use of ART. The products are the antibodies 3BNC117 and 10-1074.~      Objective:~      To see if 3BNC117 and 10-1074 are safe and can control HIV levels in the blood of people who~     are not taking ART or people who stop taking their ART during the study. .~      Eligibility:~      Adults ages 18-65 with HIV who are:~        -  on ART and willing to stop treatment for at least 28 weeks~        -  OR not taking ART with low levels of HIV in the blood~      Design:~      Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood, heart, and~     urine tests.~      Participants will get the 2 study products or salt water (placebo).

Each product will be given directly into the vein for about 1 hour.~      To help collect blood cells to study in the laboratory, participants may have a procedure~     known as leukapheresis in which blood will be removed through a needle in the arm. Some of~     the white blood cells will be separated from the blood and used for research studies to see~     how 3BNC117 and 10-1074 effects HIV and the immune system. The rest of the blood will be~     returned to the person through another needle in the arm.~      Participants will have 18 study visits over 28 weeks. They will repeat some screening tests.~     They may have leukapheresis again.~      At 8 study visits, participants will get the study products or placebo.~      All participants will be followed for at least 24 weeks after their last dose of the study~     infusions. Participants who are in the Group that stops ART will be monitored closely to make~     sure the levels of virus in their blood do not go to high. If at any time during this the~     study a person develops HIV-related symptoms, or if the viral levels go up to high levels for~     more than 4 weeks, ART will be restarted and no further infusions of 3BNC117 and 10-1074 will~     be given.~   ",C0439663,C1963724;C0262926;C3714514;C3714514;C1710032;C1457887;C3687832;C3687832;C0005767;C0005767;C0018787;C0042036;C0043047;C0005767;C0005767;C0005767;C0005767;C0005767;C0005767;C0446516;C0446516;C0084688;C3714514;C3714514;C3714514;C1321876;C0012634;C0032042;C2946261;C2946261;C0005767;C2946261;C2946261;C2946261;C3845829;C0376495;C0376495,0,0,0,0,0,0.020589157,0.01844405,2,2

NCT00109629,"""Prime-Boost"" Vaccine Schedule for Prevention of HIV Infection","This study will determine the safety and side effects of two experimental HIV vaccines given      in a ""prime-boost"" schedule. It will also monitor participants for the social impact of being      in an HIV vaccine study (e.g., problems with insurance, health care, friends, family,      employment, housing, and so forth). The vaccines are VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP (called the DNA      vaccine) and VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (called the rAd vaccine). The DNA vaccine codes for four HIV      proteins. The rAd vaccine is made using an adenovirus (a common virus that causes upper      respiratory infections, such as the common cold) that has been modified to contain DNA that      codes for three HIV proteins. These vaccines cannot cause HIV or adenoviral infections.      The study will also see if the vaccines cause an immune response; if the injection of the DNA      vaccine given using a needle and syringe is similar in safety and immune response to giving      them with a needleless injection device called a Biojector 2000; if people who already have      antibodies to adenovirus still have an immune response to rAd vaccine; and if there are      social harms that result from participating in an HIV vaccine study.      Healthy volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age may be eligible for this 42-week study.      Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests      (including pregnancy test for women), and questions regarding sexual behavior and other      practices.      Participants receive three injections (shots) of the DNA vaccine and one injection of the rAd      vaccine. All injections are given into a muscle in the upper arm (alternating right and left      arms with each injection), using a needle and syringe or the needleless Biojector 2000. The      first vaccination is given the day of enrollment into the study, and the DNA vaccinations are      given about 4 weeks apart from each other, with a minimum of 21 days between injections. The      rAd ""booster""vaccination is given at Week 24. Participants fill out a diary card at home for      5 days after each vaccination, recording their temperature and any symptoms. They come to the      clinic for follow-up 3 days each DNA vaccine injection, and call or return again 7 days after      each injection. They call a study nurse 1 or 2 days after the rAd injection.      There are 15 to 18 clinic visits during the course of the study. At each visit, participants      are checked for health changes or problems. Blood and urine samples are collected at some      visits. Participants are periodically tested for HIV and asked questions about their sexual      behavior and drug use and are counseled throughout the study on HIV risk reduction.

What is the optimal intervention for the prevention of antepartum and intrapartum           transmission of HIV?        2. What is the optimal intervention for the prevention of postpartum transmission in           breastfeeding (BF) infants?        3. What is the optimal intervention for the preservation of maternal health after the risk           period for prevention of mother-to-child-transmission ends (either at delivery or           cessation of BF)?      The overall PROMISE protocol had three separate interventional components to address each of      these three questions and was conducted at locations in Africa and other parts of the world.      Due to variations in the standard of care for HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women and      their infants at different sites, not all of these questions were relevant. Therefore, two      separate versions of the PROMISE protocol were developed, each containing only the relevant      components. The 1077BF protocol was used at sites where the standard method of infant feeding      was breastfeeding, whereas the 1077FF protocol was used at sites where the standard method of      infant feeding was formula feeding.

NCT00013520,Comparison of Three Different Initial Treatments Without Protease Inhibitors for HIV Infection,"The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of 3      anti-HIV combination treatments that do not use protease inhibitors (PIs).      The current rule for starting treatment of HIV infection is to combine members from different      classes of anti-HIV drugs, such as 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and      either a PI or a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). However, these      combinations can be complicated and difficult to take, can cause a number of side effects,      and may become ineffective. Combinations that are simpler, better tolerated, and more      effective are needed. Because PIs can cause long-term side effects and because HIV can become      resistant to many of them at the same time, anti-HIV combination treatments that do not use      PIs are being tested.",C0033607;C0019693;C0087111;C0882214,C0282519;C0282519;C0033607;C4553491;C0019693;C3539181;C0877248;C0877248;C0087111;C3242385;C0087111;C3242385;C0087111;C0332218;C0456387;C0392366;C0947630;C0013227;C0870077;C3811910;C3539181;C3539181;C4684765;C1514892;C0034770,0,0,0,206,41.2,0.016480701,0.013399892,2,2

The vaccine, called~     VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, or rAd5, is made using an adenovirus that has been modified to contain~     DNA that codes for three HIV proteins. It cannot cause HIV or adenoviral infections.~      Healthy volunteers who are not infected with the HIV virus may be eligible for this study.~     Subjects are recruited for two study groups: Group 1 comprises volunteers who are 18 to 50~     years old and have never received an HIV vaccine and Group 2 comprises volunteers who are 18~     to 55 years old and participated in a prior study in which they received at least one~     injection of the study rAd5 vaccine.~      Subjects in both groups are randomly assigned to receive the vaccine by needle or Biojector~     2000 (Registered Trademark) into a muscle in the upper arm. They call a study nurse 2 days~     after the injection, record their temperature and symptoms on a diary card at home for 5 days~     after the injection for later review, and visit the clinic two weeks after the injection for~     a checkup.~      The injection is given on the day of enrollment. Additional visits are scheduled at weeks 2,~     4, 12 and 24, when subjects are checked for health changes or problems, their use of~     medications and how they are feeling. Blood samples are collected at all clinic visits.~     Subjects are tested for HIV at the beginning and end of the study, are asked about their~     sexual behavior and drug use, and are counseled about HIV risk reduction. Women are tested~     for pregnancy at the beginning and end of the study.~      Participants in Group 2 may undergo apheresis at the 4-week visit. This procedure is done to~     collect white blood cells for tests to examine the immune response to the vaccine. Blood is~     collected through a needle in the vein of one arm and directed through a machine that~     separates the cell components. The white cells are removed and the rest of the blood is~     returned through the same needle.~      Subjects are asked about any social effects they may have experienced from participating in~     the study.

NCT00321061,Phase I Study of Vaccination Schedule of Experimental HIV Vaccines,"~     This study will test whether a vaccination schedule of experimental HIV vaccines is safe and~     whether it causes side effects in healthy adult volunteers. It will also compare the effects~     of vaccine injected into the muscle (intramuscular), just under the skin (subcutaneous), or~     into the skin (intradermal) and will monitor the social impact of being in an HIV vaccine~     study.~      Healthy volunteers 18-50 years old may be eligible for this 42-week study. Participants are~     screened for antibodies to adenovirus, a common virus that causes upper respiratory~     infections, such as the common cold. Half of the participants selected will be positive and~     half will be negative for antibodies to the virus.~      The vaccines used in this study are known as VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP (called the DNA vaccine)~     and VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (called the rAd5 vaccine). The DNA vaccine codes for four HIV~     proteins. The rAd5 vaccine is made using an adenovirus that has been modified to contain DNA~     that codes for three HIV proteins. These vaccines cannot cause HIV or adenoviral infections.~      Participants are randomly assigned to one of six possible vaccination schedules that include~     prime and booster vaccines. The first vaccinations prime the immune system and the immune~     response is then boosted later. The groups differ in the type of vaccines given (DNA vaccine~     prime with rAd5 booster or rAd5 prime with rAd5 booster), in how the vaccine is administered~     (intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intradermally) and in the schedule of administration. All~     shots are given in the upper arm. Subjects fill out a diary card at home for 5 days after~     each vaccination, recording their temperature and any symptoms. The cards are turned in to~     the clinic at the first visit after all 5 days are completed. Subjects return for clinic~     visits about 3 days after each prime vaccination and either come in or call the clinic about~     7 days after the injection. They call a study nurse 1 or 2 days after the booster~     vaccination.~      Participants have 15-20 clinic visits during the course of the study, depending on their~     vaccination schedule. At each visit, they are checked for health changes or problems, asked~     how they are feeling and if they have taken any medications or other treatments, including~     over-the-counter medicines, herbal supplements, etc. Blood and urine samples are collected at~     some visits.

More and more evidence show that PWD are more likely to be poor, vulnerable to physical and      sexual violence, and to have less access to education. Therefore, PWD are likely to have an      increased risk for HIV infection, potentially being a key population in regard to this      epidemic.      The vulnerability of PWD was recognized in 2007 by the United Nations Convention on the      Rights of Persons with Disabilities. However, data on the extent how PWD are affected by HIV      is still very limited. As a result, PWD are usually overlooked by National AIDS Control      Programmes and few projects specifically targeting them have been developed.

Maraviroc attaches to the surface of the T-cell~     that the virus uses to get into the cell and is therefore known as an entry inhibitor.~     Raltegravir blocks the virus from inserting itself into the DNA of the infected cell's~     nucleus and is therefore known as an Integrase Inhibitor. We hope to learn more about how~     antiretroviral drugs affect T cells and how immune function restores itself when HIV~     infection is treated.~   ",C0596601,C4284232;C4284232;C1871526;C1871526;C4284232;C1871526;C0021853;C0021853;C3714514;C1446409;C1446409;C0332149;C0439663;C0038351;C3687832;C0376601;C0021853;C4284232;C4284232;C0282519;C0150312;C0184511;C3496275,4,176,-1,75,25,0.014430014,0.012941129,0,2
