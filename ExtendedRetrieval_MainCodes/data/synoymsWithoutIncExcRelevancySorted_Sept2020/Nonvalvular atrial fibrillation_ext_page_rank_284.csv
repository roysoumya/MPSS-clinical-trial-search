NCT01817998,Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and Physical Exercise,"Background and study concept:      Atrial fibrillation is the new global epidemic in cardiology. With improved survival from      other cardiovascular diseases and longer living in general, the incidence and prevalence of      AF rise dramatically in all developed countries with an estimated life time risk of one in      four for all people above the age of 40 years. Similarly in Denmark, the prevalence is      estimated to almost double within 2020. It is a fatal arrhythmia with doubled mortality      compared to patients with normal sinus rhythm; this primarily caused by an increased risk of      stroke and heart failure. In particular stroke is a feared complication with a 70% risk of      fatal outcome or lasting handicaps and immense costs for each patient as well as in terms of      health costs.      Moreover, many AF patients experience a variety of symptoms and have markedly reduced quality      of life. Opposed to heart failure patients and patients who have suffered from a myocardial      infarction, AF patients are not offered any sort of rehabilitation when diagnosed.      Pharmacological treatment of the arrhythmia is challenging. Most often, individual and      careful risk evaluation including ultrasound of the heart is obligatory to choose optimal      treatment strategy and prophylactic anticoagulation. In case a new anti-arrhythmic drug is      started to restore and maintain sinus rhythm, hospitalization for at least two days with      heart rhythm monitoring is required to detect any possible potentially dangerous or even      fatal arrhythmia as a side effect to the treatment. Additionally, the first new oral      anti-arrhythmic AF drug introduced for more than twenty-five years proved to be hazardous in      a high-risk AF population and is now only used with strict precautions.      To explore the role of alternative treatment strategies and to renew handling of cardiac      arrhythmia, we have therefore set out to study the role of physical exercise in AF patients.      Our specific study aims are to examine:        1. The effect of physical exercise on AF burden        2. The effect of physical exercise on the risk of cardiovascular hospitalization      Method:      Our study is an interventional, randomized exercise study. 60 patients older than 18 years      with ECG-documented AF will be included if written informed consent is obtained. They will be      randomized 1:1 to moderate-severe (80-85% of max capacity) or low intensity (50% of max      capacity) training. Exclusion criteria are language barrier, illness inherent with an      expected survival shorter than a year, other reasons preventing the patient from training,      revealed serious cardiac disease during pre-tests, AF ablation within one year, permanent AF.      Both groups are first participating in a nurse-led educational and care program. The program      is built on two individual consultations and one team consultation with focus on education in      AF.      The patients will be thoroughly examined before randomization and after ended training period      with special ultrasound of the heart, ECG-monitored test of maximal oxygen uptake on      ergometer bicycle, 24 hours measurement of blood pressure and pulse, and blood samples. They      will all be taught to use home ECG recorders, a new handheld device. The patients will send      ECG's twice daily and if the experience cardiac symptoms for 5 months (during exercise and      two months after).      When randomized the patients will be divided in teams of ten and trained on separate teams,      so the physiotherapist closely can guide the patients in training at the correct intensity      level.      Measurements:      During and after physical exercise the burden of atrial fibrillation is measured by tele-ECG      i.e. number of ECGs with atrial fibrillation divided by total number of ECGs. ECG reporting      begins after four weeks of physical exercise and continues 2 months after last training      session.      Recording of hospitalization begins after randomization and continues one year after last      training session. All hospitalizations caused by AF or related to the AF disease (relapse of      AF, heart failure, stroke, new anti-arrhythmic medication, elective electrical cardioversion,      complications to anticoagulation, pacemaker implantation) are recorded. Also, total days in      hospital are registered.      The AF population is growing on a global scale and the disease attracts immense interest on      all international cardiology congresses. New knowledge of the effect of training for the      general population as well as the effect in the setting of established disease could have      paramount effect for prognosis, quality of life, and health costs as pharmacological      treatment is AF still holds challenges.",C0004238;C0031809;C1522704,C0542380;C0007222;C0004238;C0232202;C0004238;C0004238;C0237167;C0741933;C0019993;C0003281;C0019993;C0019993;C0018799;C0019993;C0003281;C0518214;C0034991;C3887460;C0005823;C0018801;C0018801;C0009818;C0429627;C0178913;C0018801;C0009566;C0009566;C0232201;C0009818;C0021107;C0879626;C0003811;C0237607;C0021308;C0003811;C0220825;C0041618;C0150369;C0003811;C0679199;C0003811;C1301725;C0041618;C0237607;C0013227;C0805586;C0231172;C0011900;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0424927;C0180748;C0182913;C0700287;C0030163;C0376554;C0033325;C0087111;C0184511;C0683278;C0679199;C3245501;C0332149;C1552740;C0547070;C0332128;C0543488;C0018787;C0221423;C0012634;C0277556;C0012634;C0542559;C0012634;C0038454;C0038454;C0871269;C0442726;C1518681;C1518681;C0025663;C0205082;C1552839;C0025344;C0038454;C1518681;C1518681;C1518681;C0947630;C0018787;C0018787;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0392366;C0018787;C0034107;C0175659;C0237886;C0013227;C0013227;C1273517;C1704326;C1704326;C1561543;C1561543;C0392366;C1561543;C1578513;C1578513;C1578513;C0036849;C1550472;C1578513;C1578513;C0003195;C0003195;C0003195;C4699619;C0452240;C0452240;C0452240;C0452240;C0442694;C0442694;C0442694;C0452240;C0086972;C0442694;C0452240;C0452240;C0442694;C0442694;C0442694;C4699158;C0184661;C1457887;C0180799;C0000589;C0080194;C0009797;C0009653;C1444651;C0233492;C0424927;C0456642;C1514821;C0282415;C3843236;C0202165;C2363670;C4055646;C4699604;C1561542;C1561542;C1555709;C0671679;C0949766;C0030695;C1832073;C0031809;C0031809;C0031809;C1547226;C0031809;C0031809;C1546398;C0182913;C0701928;C0612923;C0233697;C0233697;C0558255;C0679897;C0588446,0,0,0,1,1,0.00380633,0.006656562,0,0

What is not known with certainty, is whether patients with atrial fibrillation      who are having planned mitral valve surgery would do better if they also had surgical      ablation rather than medication alone to treat their atrial fibrillation.",C0004238;C0026264;C0543467;C0547070;C0543467;C0547070;C0543467;C1550655,C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C1533734;C0026264;C0026264;C0026264;C0026264;C0232197;C0026264;C0013227;C0087111;C0547070;C0547070;C0543467;C0547070;C0547070;C0547070;C0547070;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C0018792;C0392366;C0018792;C0018787;C0028778;C0018787;C0947630;C0439044;C1273517;C1273517;C0013227;C1578513;C0184661;C0086960;C0033213;C0087130;C1328018;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C4698437;C4082977,549,9360,0,38,38,0.004561795,0.004981114,0,0
NCT01161251,Atrial Fibrillation Registry for Ankle-brachial Index Prevalence Assessment: Collaborative Italian Study.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained dysrhythmia encountered in clinical      practice in North America and Europe, accounting for approximately one-third of all      hospitalizations for a cardiac rhythm abnormality. The presence of AF markedly increases the      patient's risk for developing arterial embolism and stroke, depending on the presence of      other clinical conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes. AF is associated with a      fivefold increased risk for stroke, and is estimated to cause 15% of all strokes.      Patients with AF frequently have several risk factors for atherosclerosis, including      hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Accordingly, systemic signs of atherosclerosis can      be detected in AF patients, and these likely accounts for an enhanced risk of coronary heart      disease. In addition to cerebrovascular disease, patients with AF may suffer from coronary      events including myocardial infarction (MI), but the rate of MI in AF patients seems to be      variable, but often underestimated.      Moreover, coexistence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a relevant clinical sign of      systemic atherosclerosis.      Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive PAD measurement, even      at the pre-symptomatic phase when intervention can improve prognosis and prevent or delay      severe complications ABI is calculated by measuring the systolic blood pressure in the      posterior tibial and/or the dorsalis pedis arteries either in both legs or 1 leg chosen at      random (using a Doppler probe or alternative pulse sensor), with the lowest ankle pressure      then divided by the brachial systolic blood pressure. In addition to peripheral artery      disease, the ABI also is an indicator of generalized atherosclerosis because lower levels      have been associated with higher rates of concomitant coronary and cerebrovascular disease,      and with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors.      Two large studies in patients with AF document the existence of PAD in about 3-5% of      patients. It is possible, however, that such an incidence has been underestimated as only      symptomatic patients were considered as affected by PAD. As PAD is an important marker of      systemic atherosclerosis, its association with AF reinforces the concept that patients with      AF have systemic atherosclerosis that potentially account for coronary complications.      To date, a national registry of AF patients is not available to verify the real impact of      cardiovascular events in this clinical setting.",C0004238;C0031809;C0034975;C0003086;C0600653;C0947630;C0224240,C0085096;C0007820;C0871470;C0871470;C0007820;C0027051;C1320716;C3888326;C0004238;C0549124;C0489868;C0019993;C0004153;C0004153;C0004153;C0004153;C0004153;C0004153;C3887460;C0009566;C0009566;C0020538;C0035648;C0020538;C0242339;C0184661;C0035648;C0003811;C0004083;C0033325;C0021212;C0237607;C0392148;C0392148;C0011849;C0011849;C0442726;C0018787;C0018787;C0003842;C0460139;C0018787;C0392148;C1301746;C0332149;C0018787;C0034975;C0018787;C0038454;C0012634;C0554756;C0012634;C0947630;C0542559;C3245511;C0871269;C0038454;C0038454;C0332148;C0683278;C0205082;C0183210;C0005516;C0018787;C0182400;C0034107;C0003086;C1140621;C0182158;C0182158;C1140621;C0182158;C0182158;C0182158;C0425358;C0231221;C0231221;C0224463;C0012634;C4699158;C1550655;C0184511;C1704258;C0723323;C1512346;C0202165;C4084912;C0224240;C0729829;C1441792;C3272565;C3272565;C4553760;C3272565;C1334278;C3854058;C3272565;C4699193,0,0,1,9,4.5,0.003334239,0.004971953,0,0

NCT01942408,The Effect of Early Repeat Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Ablation on AF Recurrence,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest condition affecting the rhythm of the heart and      causes an irregular and often rapid heartbeat. Developing this condition may cause      significant health problems and symptoms that affect normal day-to-day activities. Patients      with AF also have a shorter life expectancy on average. Tablets used to try to normalise the      heart rhythm rarely work well. As a result, doctors have devised a treatment to try to cure      this condition. Special wires (called catheters) are used to deliver heat energy (called      ablation) on the inside surface of the heart. This technique has been used more and more in      recent years for patients with troublesome symptoms due to AF.      The aim of the treatment is to draw lines of ablation in specific places in the heart.      Unfortunately, a lot of patients (almost 50%) get AF again after this treatment and most of      these patients have a second treatment performed. It is usually found at this second      treatment that gaps have developed in the lines of ablation that were drawn the first time      around. The investigators think that electively doing a second treatment to close these gaps      a couple of months after the first treatment may mean that fewer of these patients will get      AF again in the future. The investigators also want to find out what factors make a line of      ablation less likely to develop gaps.      In this study, participants will be assigned to one of two groups:        1. a ""standard care"" group, who will have a single treatment initially.        2. a ""repeat study"" group, who will have the initial treatment followed by a second           treatment 8-10 weeks later.      For patients in the ""repeat study group"", investigators will see how many have developed gaps      since their first treatment. The investigators will look at where these gaps are and will      compare this with information collected during the first treatment to try to work out why the      gap has developed. Any gaps found at the second treatment will be closed again.      All participants will then be monitored carefully over 12 months to see how many from each      group get AF again. To do this, all participants will be given a handheld heart rhythm      monitor to keep until the end of the study. This device is simple to use. Participants will      be asked to make a 30 second recording of their heart rhythm each day and also whenever they      have symptoms. These recordings will be downloaded at review appointments arranged 6 weeks, 3      months, 6 months and 12 months after the initial ablation procedure.",C0004238;C2825055;C0547070,C0004238;C0039231;C0012634;C0012634;C0087111;C0012634;C0085590;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0184661;C0547070;C0547070;C1552740;C0547070;C0547070;C1552601;C2828392;C0547070;C0308779;C0030695;C0871269;C0001721;C1553386;C0871269;C0424589;C0332148;C1552839;C0087136;C0871269;C0871269;C0282443;C0018787;C0018787;C0018787;C0018787;C0039869;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C3244317;C0018787;C0947630;C0018787;C1273517;C1273517;C1273517;C1561538;C1561538;C0042789;C0042789;C1561538;C4699604;C4699604;C0424818;C0033213;C1550655;C1457887;C1457887;C3242430;C0429001;C0723323;C2363670;C2363670;C2363670;C1561542;C1561542;C1561542;C1552839;C1552839;C1552839;C1552839;C0030695;C0701928;C2363670,0,0,0,0,0,0.004764166,0.004750285,0,0

NCT00806689,Full Disclosure Observational Cardiac Rhythm Documentation Follow-up After Surgical Atrial Fibrillation Therapy,"24 hour Holter monitoring (24HM) is commonly used to assess cardiac rhythm after surgical      therapy of atrial fibrillation. This ""snapshot"" rhythm documentation leaves a large      diagnostic window of non recorded atrial arrhythmias and as such a large amount of      uncertainty in follow-up result assessment. To improve accuracy of rhythm surveillance thus      gaining a more ""real-life"" scenario of post surgical ablation therapy cardiac rhythm a new      insertable cardiac rhythm monitor device (Reveal?? XT 9525, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN,      USA) with full observational continuous heart rhythm documentation is implanted.      In order to verify different follow-up strategies after surgical atrial fibrillation therapy,      a comparison of different follow-up scenarios (symptoms, different cardiac documentation      devices i.e. ECG and 24 hour Holter monitor, at different follow-up time points) is performed      intraindividually.

NCT00457834,Bi-Ventricular Pacing in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Heart Failure (BIFF-Study),"Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is used to treat dilated heart failure with      discoordinate contraction. Dyssynchrony typically stems from electrical delay leading to      mechanical delay between the septal and lateral walls. Right ventricular apical pacing might      be associated with long-term adverse effects on left ventricular function, and alternative      pacing sites such as high septal or RVOT has been suggested. Previous studies have however      been conflicting. The aim of this study is to determine if bi-ventricular pacing from RVOT +      LV is better than RVapex+LV. To avoid influence from possible atrial delay only patients with      chronic atrial fibrillation are included. All patients will receive a bi-ventricular      pacemaker with 3 leads placed in RVapex, RVOT and via coronary sinus to pace the left      ventricle.

Those clots can travel in the blood      circulation to the brain and cause a brain attack (""a stroke""). To prevent those clots      forming, blood thinners (anti-coagulants) are used.

NCT01091597,Pulmonary Vein (PV) Isolation Versus Box Isolation for the Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation,"Curative catheter ablation has been established as an effective therapeutic option for atrial      fibrillation (AF) that is resistant to pharmacologic rhythm or rate control. However,      standard ablative approaches targeting the pulmonary veins (PVs) are associated with a      success rate as low as 40%. In a recent study, Kumagai et al. described a new approach of      catheter ablation of AF isolating the posterior left atrium including all PVs (called Box      Isolation). In Kumagai's study, 46 patients with symptomatic AF underwent box isolation. At 6      months follow up, 43 of 46 patients (93%) were arrhythmia free without antiarrhythmic drugs,      with a single procedure success rate of 87% (40/46). This study provided new evidence      supporting the hypothesis that the posterior wall is of high importance for the maintenance      of AF.

NCT01058980,ADenosine Following Pulmonary Vein Isolation to Target Dormant Conduction Elimination: the ADVICE Trial,"~     Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, impairs quality of life~     and increases stroke risk and mortality. Despite advances in medical treatment, AF remains~     uncontrolled in many patients. In many patients, AF is initiated by abnormal electrical~     impulses from the pulmonary veins. A catheter ablation procedure called pulmonary vein~     isolation (PVI) has therefore been developed, using heat to isolate the PV foci from the~     heart. PVI is very effective, but must be repeated in up to 50% of cases because the foci~     isolation is not permanent after initial PVI. The intravenous administration of a drug called~     adenosine during the PVI procedure can unmask residual conduction that would otherwise remain~     unnoticed, so-called dormant conduction. In our experience, additional ablation guided by~     adenosine reduces AF recurrence and the need for a repeat PVI procedure. However, the~     adenosine-guided approach has not yet been proven as standard therapy. The present study, to~     be conducted at 15 clinical centres in Canada, Europe and Australia is therefore intended to~     evaluate the efficacy of adenosine-guided ablation to prevent AF recurrence. Five hundred~     twenty-six patients will be included in the study, which should be completed within 2 years.~     In all patients, the presence of dormant conduction will be tested with adenosine during PVI.~     If dormant conduction is observed, additional ablation will be performed in half of these~     patients selected randomly. If there is no dormant conduction, randomly selected patients~     will be followed in a registry. If the adenosine-guided approach is demonstrated to improve~     the success rate of PVI procedures, it should become the standard approach for a permanent~     cure of AF, and therefore benefit patients by reducing arrhythmia recurrence,~     hospitalizations and the need for repeat interventions.~   ",C0221102;C0001443;C0150600;C0034090,C0004238;C0034090;C0596545;C0034897;C0034897;C0003811;C0001443;C0001443;C0001443;C0001443;C0001443;C0001443;C0205161;C0547070;C0547070;C0547070;C0547070;C0150312;C0871269;C0038454;C0018787;C0018787;C0019993;C0034090;C0034897;C3845829;C2947996;C0184511;C0376495,0,0,-1,95,23.75,0.000741841,0.004336902,0,0

NCT00597077,Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure Trial,"Heart failure is a clinical syndrome where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to      satisfy the organism's metabolic needs. Heart failure has become a major clinical and public      health problem with approximately 300,000 Canadians being affected. Atrial fibrillation is a      rhythm disorder in which the upper chambers of the heart (the atria) are paralyzed by      continuous electrical activity. Some of the continuous chaotic electrical activity in the      atria travels to the lower cavities of the heart (the ventricles) causing then to beat      irregularly and very rapidly. It is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 5% of      individuals 65 years and older and it is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Both      conditions (heart failure and atrial fibrillation) often co-exist in the same patient. Heart      failure promotes atrial fibrillation and atrial fibrillation aggravates heart failure. The      Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure (AF-CHF) trial is investigating whether      preservation of normal cardiac rhythm influences mortality and morbidity.

NCT01014741,Modified Ablation Guided by Ibutilide Use in Chronic Atrial Fibrillation,"~     Procedures for ablation of persistent or long lasting atrial fibrillation are frequently long~     and require extensive ablation. Some electrophysiologists administer the drug ibutilide~     during these procedures to help organize the fibrillatory activity of the left atrium with~     the hope that this may shorten the length of the procedure and duration of ablation needed.~     Currently there is no standardized approach of administering the drug ibutilide during these~     procedures, thus the investigators cannot be certain that administering this drug does in~     fact facilitate the procedure. The aim of the MAGIC-AF Trial is to see if administering a~     standard dose of the drug ibutilide at a standard time in the procedure can allow for a~     reduction in the ablation procedure time.

NCT01447862,Vernakalant Versus Ibutilide In Recent-Onset Atrial Fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is expected to affect about 30      million North Americans and Europeans by 2050. Atrial fibrillation is associated with      increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with stroke being an especially important      and potentially devastating complication. Many studies have investigated the efficacy of      different drugs in converting atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. There are numerous      randomized controlled trials that have tested the efficacy of agents against placebo and some      trials that directly compared the efficacy of two or more different drugs. The class III      antiarrhythmic drug Ibutilde is approved for the acute termination of atrial fibrillation and      atrial flutter of recent onset and has been shown to be superior to sotalol and equivalent to      flecainide in this indication. Recently, the relatively atrial selective antiarrhythmic agent      vernakalant has been approved by the European Commission for the rapid conversion of recent      onset AF to sinus rhythm in adults. The investigators hypothesize that the period of time      needed for cardioversion to sinus rhythm and the efficacy of cardioversion within 90 minutes      is different between vernakalant and ibutilide in patients with recent-onset atrial      fibrillation.",C0004238;C2001572;C0082966,C0282440;C1301700;C0003195;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0003195;C0004238;C0003811;C0004239;C0013778;C0013778;C0009566;C0232201;C0232201;C0232201;C0232197;C2001572;C2001572;C0016229;C0082966;C0947630;C0032042;C0037707;C3245511;C0001721;C0038454;C0392366;C0018792;C0025344;C0018792;C0013227;C0013227;C0456387;C0425358;C1148554;C4084912;C4055646;C1328018;C1714809;C0056170;C0151576,0,0,0,1,1,0.00380576,0.004005609,0,0

This study      will evaluate the effectiveness of fish oil at decreasing the recurrence of AF and will      examine the reasons why fish oil may reduce this risk.,C0004238;C4553491;C2825055;C0016157;C1947943,C0004238;C0039231;C4553491;C1458156;C0442797;C1458156;C0012634;C0016157;C0016157;C0016157;C0871269;C0018787;C0947630;C0000589;C0220825;C1947943,116,2090,0,19,19,0.003186755,0.003849999,0,0
NCT00232245,Use of Fish Oils to Reduce the Frequency and Duration of Episodes of Atrial Fibrillation in Patients With Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation.,The purpose of this study is to investigate whether fish oil supplements may reduce the      frequency and duration of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation episodes.      Atrial fibrillation is a heart condition which effects a large percentage of the population .      Atrial fibrillation is a condition frequently experienced by people who have had pacemakers      inserted .      Certain Pacemakers have sophisticated monitoring features that are able to recognise episodes      of atrial fibrillation.      Fish oil supplements may be of benefit to patients with heart problems.Recent evidence      suggests that fish oils may be beneficial to patients with rhythm disturbances.

Also, it is      known that as many as half of all patients with known AF may not be receiving appropriate      anticoagulation for their condition. New technologies are making it possible to improve AF      detection. Subjects in this study will be screened for AF using three simple methods: a      30-second pulse check, a hand-held single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) device and a blood      pressure monitor with built-in AF screening capabilities.

NCT01858779,Know Your Pulse Post Stroke-Measurement of Peripheral Pulse for Detection of Atrial Fibrillation After Ischemic Stroke,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cause of cardioembolism and a leading cause of      ischemic stroke. The diagnosis of AF after cerebral ischemia is difficult to establish even      during the treatment at specialised stroke units, as paroxysmal episodes may terminate      spontaneously before arrival at the hospital and do not always show early recurrence.      However, the diagnosis of AF is of particular clinical relevance since adaequate      anticoagulation is one of the most effective secondary preventive treatments in stroke. The      detection rate of AF after stroke increases progressively by extending the duration and      intensity of cardiac monitoring. For this purpose innovative medical devices and implantable      event recorders have been suggested. However, high socioeconomic expenses, malcompliance and      the invasiveness of some of these approaches currently limit their use to a minority of      affected patients, while the growing number of stroke survivors is lacking access to free and      simple screening tools.      For primary prevention, the measurement of the peripheral pulse (MPP) is currently the only      guideline-recommended screening method among individuals aged 65 years or older. In contrast,      MPP has never been applied in the setting of secondary stroke prevention, probably because      several factors were expected to interfere with this simple technique, including sensomotor      and neuropsychiologic handicaps of stroke patients 18. This study investigates feasibility      and validity of MPP in this cohort (pilot phase) and compares daily MPP for 6 months with      repeated holter-ECG in patients after ischemic stroke.",C0004238;C0948008;C1511790;C0038454;C0034107;C0034107;C3843236,C0004238;C0150496;C0033144;C0917798;C1277289;C0948008;C0003281;C0025080;C0948008;C1458156;C0087111;C0011900;C0332218;C0087111;C0011900;C0027627;C0182913;C0199230;C0282423;C0199230;C0027627;C0231172;C0332148;C0542559;C3245511;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0025663;C0038454;C0034107;C0947630;C3843802;C1553407;C0021102;C0723323;C0723323;C0202165;C1511790;C0332534;C0449900;C4055646;C1561542;C0015733;C3272565,0,0,0,1,1,0.003394454,0.00360235,0,0
NCT02578979,Serial ECG Versus Holter to Detect Atrial Fibrillation in Elderly Ischemic Stroke Patients,"Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is often undetected because characteristics such as short      duration, episodic, and frequently asymptomatic nature make it challenging to diagnose at the      bedside, leading to suboptimal secondary prevention. It is not uncommon for paroxysmal atrial      fibrillation to be undetected in a single electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission. Conventional      24-hour Holter monitoring is often used to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. However,      systematic review suggests Holter monitoring will identify atrial fibrillation in only an      additional 4.6% of patients, no better than detection rates observed in groups lacking      routine monitoring. On the other hand, for ischemic stroke patients with sinus rhythm at      baseline but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation still suspected, no recommendation beyond      repeated 12-lead ECGs is made in the United Kingdom guideline. Serial 12-lead ECG has been      used to detect possible paroxysmal atrial fibrillation among acute ischemic stroke patients      and found 15 new cases of atrial fibrillation in 133 acute ischemic stroke patients (11.3%)      without atrial fibrillation at baseline. The optimal investigation strategy, including      modality, duration of investigation, and patient subgroup remains undefined, not only for      efficacy in the detection of atrial fibrillation, but also cost-effectiveness in healthcare      systems. The objective of this project is to conduct a pragmatic multicenter randomized      controlled trial for the comparison of serial 12-lead ECG once daily for 5 days and 24-hour      Holter to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in acute ischemic stroke patients without      atrial fibrillation identified by baseline ECG or history.",C0004238;C0948008;C1550655,C0235480;C0235480;C0235480;C0235480;C0235480;C0679699;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0004238;C0013798;C1955832;C0948008;C0948008;C0948008;C0948008;C1552578;C1552578;C4553491;C0231221;C0232197;C0232201;C0150369;C0150369;C0150369;C0086388;C0184666;C0282423;C0018017;C0011900;C0332149;C0679199;C0262512;C0018792;C0087136;C0442726;C1552839;C0442726;C0031082;C0442726;C1273517;C0018563;C1273517;C1578513;C0282440;C1550043;C4684838;C0022396;C0442726;C0442726;C1511790;C1511790;C0332534;C3858576;C0332534;C0729829;C0728774;C0728774;C1547664;C0728774,0,0,0,0,0,0.004817584,0.003601052,0,0

NCT00886080,The Effect of Arrhythmia Surgery on Quality of Life in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Cardiac Surgery,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is connected with an increased morbidity and mortality. In addition,      quality of life is diminished due to palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness and syncope. AF is      frequently associated with valvular and coronary disease. In the AF patients undergoing      valvular or coronary surgery the arrhythmia almost always relapses. For symptom control      anti-arrhythmic drugs and cardioversion are used but breakthrough arrhythmias and side      effects of the drugs happen frequently. For more effective symptom control ""add-on""      arrhythmia surgery is being advocated. However, at present the investigators do not know      whether add-on arrhythmia surgery indeed affects morbidity and quality of life.      The hypothesis being studied is that add-on arrhythmia surgery in patients with AF undergoing      valvular or coronary surgery improves quality of life, establishes chronic sinus rhythm and      reduces perioperative and long-term morbidity associated with AF.",C0004238;C0518214;C0018821;C0003811;C0543467;C1550655,C0004238;C0010068;C0518214;C1274136;C1274136;C0518214;C0518214;C0013778;C0030252;C0232201;C0003811;C0003811;C0003811;C0003811;C0003811;C0220880;C0012833;C0220880;C0220880;C0018787;C0018787;C0013404;C0039070;C0543467;C0543467;C0150312;C0543467;C0543467;C0543467;C0013227;C0013227;C1273517;C0003195;C3844113;C0277556;C1518681;C0001721;C0184511;C1880354;C0151576,0,0,0,4,4,0.00385758,0.00337255,0,0

NCT02918396,The Substrate and Intervention Mechanisms for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Trial,"~     Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia with increasing~     morbidity and mortality. A catheter-based AF ablation technique that isolates pulmonary veins~     (PV) from the left atrium has been established to disrupt AF. Despite significant~     development, AF ablation with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is reported to have a success~     rate of 40-80% in various AF populations.~      Persistent AF appears to be more reliant upon fibroblast proliferation and myocyte-fibroblast~     coupling than paroxysmal AF with obvious implications on its management. Despite the~     knowledge that fibrotic substrate is responsible for the perpetuation of persistent AF,~     several ablation techniques targeting these extra-pulmonary veins sites have failed to prove~     an additional benefit to PVI alone. Nevertheless, two recently developed technologies, aimed~     at detecting AF substrate with high precision, seem to constitute a potential breakthrough in~     the management of persistent AF. On one hand, late gadolinium-enhanced MRI (LGE-MRI) is a~     well-established method to identify fibrosis in the myocardium. Recent reports from a single~     center have shown that MRI-based left atrial fibrosis detection is able to predict the~     outcome of the procedure. Hence, targeting lesions seen on LGE-MRI in the setting of~     persistent AF is an option yet to be explored and compared to the widely adopted, yet~     suboptimal, PVI. On another hand, a novel ablation method with promising results is focal~     impulse and rotor modulation (FIRM). Undergoing wide sampling of the atria with~     spatiotemporal and computational mapping while in AF has identified areas with stable~     organized rotational electrical activity (rotors). Several studies are under way to prove the~     reproducibility of rotor mapping, with more groups reporting improved rates of acute and~     long-term suppression of AF with ablation of FIRM-identified rotors.~      The SIMPle AF study will be a randomized clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that~     ablation tailored to the underlying substrate using either LGE-detected dense scar or rotor~     anchor sites predicted by computational modeling is superior to anatomic non-tailored PVI~     ablation in patients with persistent AF. For the present study, the investigators plan to~     enroll a total of 30 patients.~   ",C2585653,C0004238;C0003811;C0034090;C0301625;C0016911;C0376554;C1511790;C0700287;C0547070;C0547070;C0547070;C0016059;C0016059;C0547070;C0184511;C0547070;C0547070;C0547070;C0150312;C3854239;C0018563;C0018563;C0034090;C0034090;C0684224;C0221198;C0025663;C0025663;C0600091;C0600091;C0746922;C2609570;C1449882;C2732140;C0185026,0,15,-1,0,0,0.000879134,0.003270681,0,0

NCT01812200,Antithrombotic Triple Therapy in Humans,"~     Background:The acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a complication of coronary artery disease~     (CAD) and associated with increased mortality. Dual antiplatelet therapy of acetylsalicylic~     acid (ASA) with P2Y12 receptor antagonists such as clopidogrel is a cornerstone in the~     treatment of patients with advanced CAD. Due to delayed onset of action, intersubject~     variability or resistance to clopidogrel, different platelet aggregation inhibitors have been~     developed. Ticagrelor is a reversible P2Y12 receptor antagonist with superior efficacy~     compared to clopidogrel in the prevention of cardiovascular death in these patients.~      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is also associated with thromboembolic events and substantial~     mortality. Beside vitamin K antagonists (VKA, phenprocoumon) for stroke prevention in~     patients with AF, the direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban and the direct thrombin~     inhibitor dabigatran have recently received approval for prophylactic treatment of patients~     with non-valvular AF.~      However, there is a lack of efficacy or safety data for the combined impact of antithrombotic~     drugs in patients requiring arterial and venous thromboembolic prophylaxis due to their~     underlying co-morbidities.~      Study objectives: To evaluate the effect of ticagrelor + ASA in combination with dabigatran,~     rivaroxaban or phenprocoumon at steady state on markers of coagulation activation. The~     effects on coagulation activation will also be studied after a single dose of dabigatran,~     rivaroxaban or ticagrelor and at a therapeutic INR of phenprocoumon.~      Study design: A single-centre, prospective, randomized, controlled, analyst-blinded study in~     three parallel-groups. Subjects will receive ticagrelor + ASA in combination with dabigatran~     (treatment A), rivaroxaban (treatment B) or phenprocoumon (treatment C). All IMPs will be~     administered at doses indicated for stroke prevention in AF or ACS. Markers on thrombin~     generation and platelet activation will be studied in venous blood where coagulation is in~     resting state and in shed blood where the clotting system is activated in the~     microvasculature in vivo: prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), thrombin-anti-thrombin (TAT),~     ??-thromboglobulin (??-TG), D-Dimer, thromboxane B2 (TxB2), CD40 ligand (CD40L), p-Selectin.~     Further, the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), inhibition of factor Xa activity, activated~     partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), Biophen?? and Hemoclot?? will be~     assessed in venous blood.~      Study population: A total of 60 healthy, non-smoking and drug-free male volunteers will be~     enrolled in this trial and randomized into one of three balanced groups (treatment A, B and~     C; n = 20 per group).~      Main outcome variables: ??-TG, F1+2 and TAT in shed blood~      Additional outcome variables:~        -  D-Dimer, TxB2, CD40L and p-Selectin in shed blood~        -  ??-TG, F1+2, TAT, D-Dimer, TxB2, CD40L, p-Selectin, ETP, aPTT, PT, inhibition of factor~          Xa, Biophen?? and Hemoclot?? in venous blood~      Risk/ benefit assessment:Total blood loss will be, dependent on treatment allocation, between~     330 ml and 510 ml throughout the entire study period of 4 - 5 weeks. This amount of venous~     blood is considered to be acceptable in this healthy population. Blood sampling procedures~     may cause mild and transient pain. A minor haematoma may occur at the site of needle~     insertions. Bleeding time incisions may leave small persistent scars. Administration of the~     study drugs, in particular as triple combination for 5 days, results in transient~     hypocoagulability and may cause overt or occult bleeding. The risk is considered low in the~     healthy subjects under study. Continuous monitoring of safety parameters (haemoglobin,~     haematocrit, platelet count, coagulation) and surveillance of the overall status will be~     performed during study participation. Subjects will be instructed to avoid vigorous physical~     exercise and handling of hazardous machinery during study participation. ASA, dabigatran and~     rivaroxaban can cause gastrointestinal discomfort. Other side effects are rare.~      The combination of these novel anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, ticagrelor) has not~     been investigated so far. Conducting this study in a healthy population limits potential~     bleeding risk reported from drug interactions and impaired liver or renal function, which may~     influence the pharmacokinetics and -dynamics of the investigational products.~      This study can provide information on haemostatic system activation in vivo during triple~     treatment with antithrombotic drugs, which is indicated for patients with AF and ACS. The~     results of this study may provide dosing guidance for risk reduction of patients with ACS and~     AF.~   ",0,C0032177;C0199176;C3653316;C0004238;C0235828;C0205042;C3887460;C0032181;C0003280;C1739768;C0199176;C1739768;C1739768;C1739768;C0033706;C0033706;C1739768;C1739768;C0237834;C2348066;C0021467;C0021467;C3163616;C2348066;C2348066;C0039082;C0040018;C0040018;C0040018;C1832073;C0038454;C0038454;C3687832;C0005767;C0005767;C0005767;C0005767;C3687832;C0023884;C3687832;C0030605;C0030605;C0030193;C3669283;C0368931;C0368931;C2348066;C0040018;C0040018;C0486805;C1861172;C0012634;C0014653;C0596601;C0030605;C2348066;C2348066;C0723338;C0723338;C3850102;C0598695;C0009566;C0040038;C2598115;C0005767;C0005767;C0005767;C3845829;C2947996;C0018935;C0180112;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495,0,0,-1,4,4,0.00036245,0.003254679,0,0

NCT03753139,Identification of Arrhythmias With One-time ECG,"~     In Western countries, every sixth person in their lifetime and 15,000 people in Finland have~     a new stroke each year.

NCT02042534,Rivaroxaban Versus Warfarin in Acute Ischemic Stroke With Atrial Fibrillation,"Rationale Acute ischemic stroke due to atrial fibrillation (AF) carries a high risk for early      recurrence. In acute stage, guidelines recommend aspirin, but do not recommend      anticoagulation due to the increased risk of intracranial bleeding. Since, aspirin has a      limited efficacy of preventing recurrent stroke in AF, expert consensus suggests early      anticoagulation in non-severe stroke with AF. The current practice for acute ischemic stroke      patients with AF is delayed warfarin administration with aspirin use for non-minor stroke or      immediate warfarin administration (sometimes with heparin bridging) for minor stroke.      However, conventional anticoagulation with warfarin in acute ischemic stroke with AF has the      following limitations: 1) risk of intracranial bleeding particularly in acute stage, 2)      delayed action and transient paradoxical thrombogenic tendency due to the inhibition of      protein C, resulting in the risk of early recurrent embolic stroke, and 3) prolongation of      hospitalization waiting for full anticoagulation. In contrast, as compared to warfarin,      rivaroxaban is advantageous for reduced risk of intracranial bleeding and immediate      anticoagulation efficacy.      Goal The current trial will examine whether early initiation (within 5 days from stroke      onset) of rivaroxaban as compared to conventional warfarin would reduce intracranial      bleeding, recurrent embolic stroke, and hospital stay in patients with acute ischemic stroke      due to AF.",C0004238;C0948008;C1739768;C0043031;C1547229,C0151699;C0151699;C0151699;C0004238;C0948008;C0003281;C0003281;C0948008;C0003281;C0948008;C0019993;C0003281;C0003281;C0948008;C1533734;C1533734;C0262469;C0262469;C0524466;C1739768;C1739768;C1458156;C0162791;C0021467;C0589507;C0332167;C1697779;C0033621;C1697779;C0237607;C0043031;C0043031;C0043031;C0043031;C0043031;C0019080;C0699809;C0004057;C0004057;C0004057;C0019134;C0038454;C0205082;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C1547229;C1300072;C1300072;C0018017;C4699158;C0000589;C1550450;C0449900;C0018792;C3834249;C0011202,216,4888,0,6,3,0.003457646,0.003131073,0,0

The~     source of a cardioembolic event is a thrombus, which usually forms in the left atrial~     appendage (LAA). The prevention of cardioembolic events involves treatment with anticoagulant~     drugs, which were limited to, until recently, vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin).~     Anticoagulant treatment with warfarin can lead to adverse bleeding events, some of which can~     be life threatening. Recently, two new options for thrombus prevention have been developed.~     The first is the novel anticoagulants (NOAC), which were associated with slightly better~     safety profiles due to a lower frequency of intracranial bleeding in large randomized trials~     .

The guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology recommend~     opportunistic screening for AF by pulse check at each general practitioner visit for all~     patients aged 65 years or older.~      The objective of this study was to test whether an opportunistic AF screening with a~     hand-held diagnostic tool in a German pharmacy setting is useful in detecting unknown AF~     among people in the age of 65 and older. Besides a pulse palpation with a hand-held ECG-stick~     the screening in the pharmacies also includes a questionnaire related to demographics and~     medical history of the subject as well as several questions concerning the stroke risk~     stratification (CHA?S?VASc). Every subject with a positive test result (indication on AF)~     is insistently asked to make an appointment with his or her general practitioner. The subject~     receives an information letter for his or her general practitioner that adverts to the~     positive screening result and the necessity of further diagnostic Investigation.~      In order to assess the incidence of unknown AF as well as accomplish the secondary objectives~     of this study, two follow-ups by means of telephone interviews are performed. First, all~     subjects with a positive test result are called 8 weeks after the screening in the pharmacies~     was conducted. The subject is asked several questions concerning personal data/demographics,~     the stroke risk (CHA?S?VASc), the medical history regarding to dyspnea and stroke, the~     bleeding risk (HAS-Bled), the medication, the device, diagnostic, the therapy, the~     Intervention and the mace. 12 months after the screening in the pharmacies was performed, all~     participating subjects were called. The list of questions is similar to the one that is used~     during the first telephone interviews after eight weeks.~   ",C0004238;C1710032,C0004238;C0262926;C0262926;C0456984;C0456984;C0003811;C0162791;C1511790;C1710032;C1710032;C0030247;C1710032;C1710032;C1710032;C1710032;C1446409;C1446409;C1446409;C0013404;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0038454;C0034107;C0034107;C0018563;C0018563;C0745732;C0034394;C4284232;C1522577;C0040038;C2947996;C2947996,0,0,-1,0,0,0.005069994,0.002317592,0,0

NCT01247545,Effect of Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning on Clinical Outcomes in CABG Surgery,"~     Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the UK, accounting for 124,000~     deaths (2006) and costing the UK economy over ??7.9 billion a year. Patients with severe CHD~     are usually treated by coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, the risks of which are~     increasing due to older and sicker patients being operated on. New treatment strategies are~     therefore required to improve health outcomes in these high-risk patients undergoing CABG~     with or without valve (CABG??valve) surgery.~      The hypothesis tested in this research proposal is that remote ischaemic preconditioning~     (RIC), a virtually cost-free, non-pharmacological and simple non-invasive strategy for~     reducing the damage to the heart muscle at the time of surgery, improves health outcomes in~     high-risk patients undergoing CABG??valve surgery.~      In this research project, 1610 high-risk patients undergoing CABG??valve surgery will be~     recruited via 28 UK hospitals performing heart surgery. Patients will be randomly allocated~     to receive either RIC or control. For RIC, a blood pressure cuff will be placed on the upper~     arm to temporarily deprive it of oxygen and nutrients, an intervention which has been shown~     in the investigators pilot studies to reduce damage to the heart muscle by up to 40% during~     CABG??valve surgery. The investigators will determine whether RIC can improve health outcomes~     in terms of better patient survival, less heart attacks and strokes, shorter hospital stay;~     less damage to the heart, kidney and brain during surgery; better heart function post-surgery~     and less chance of developing heart failure; better exercise tolerance and quality of life.~   ",C0871117,C0010068;C0180208;C0162521;C0205042;C0007465;C0018801;C3888388;C0030054;C0022646;C0018787;C0018787;C0018787;C0018787;C0018787;C0006104;C0018787;C0446516;C0871117;C0184511;C0184511;C0038454;C0184511;C0376495,0,0,-1,276,92,0.003624502,0.001941508,0,0

Nevertheless, equally impressive is the lack of clinically~     applicable therapeutic strategies that could mitigate these processes, thus providing~     significant cardioprotection. Despite the well-known fact that inflammation plays an~     important role in coronary artery disease development and progression, there have been few~     attempts to systematically examine the potential role of anti-inflammatory treatment in this~     setting, possibly because of a lack in anti-inflammatory agents without the adverse~     cardiovascular safety profile of corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.~     Colchicine is a substance with potent anti-inflammatory properties, having a unique mechanism~     of action, which allows for safe use in patients with cardiovascular disease.~      The purpose of the present clinical study is to test the hypothesis that a short course of~     treatment with colchicine could lead to reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in~     acute MI.~   ",C0027051,C0003209;C1956346;C0027051;C3887460;C3887460;C3887460;C0021368;C0022116;C0150312;C0332128;C3536840;C1522240;C1522240;C0012634;C0332149;C0376495;C1630418;C0376495,0,0,-1,0,0,0.003624502,0.001356961,0,0

NCT00722319,Ongoing WARfarin and Coronary STENTing,"~     Patients on warfarin treatment pose particular problems when undergoing percutaneous coronary~     intervention with stent implantation (PCI-S), because of the poor definition of the optimal~     antithrombotic strategies to be adopted both peri-procedurally and during the 4 (or more)~     weeks after PCI-S, when dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is~     recommended. In the absence of solid evidence-based data, no definite recommendations for the~     management of this patient subset are currently given in the guidelines on percutaneous~     coronary intervention issued by the most prominent Cardiology Associations. Indeed, a high~     variability has been reported in the current antithrombotic strategies, which may consist in~     either the temporary substitution of warfarin by dual antiplatelet treatment or the~     combination of warfarin and aspirin or clopidogrel or both. Peri-procedural bridging therapy~     with either intravenous unfractionated or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin is also~     variably carried out. Purpose of this registry is to determine in patients on warfarin~     treatment undergoing PCI-S: 1) the contemporary peri-procedural and medium-term~     antithrombotic management; and 2) the relative safety and efficacy of the various~     antithrombotic regimens.~   ",C0043031;C2348535,C0004083;C1704788;C0162791;C0043031;C0043031;C0043031;C0004057;C0004057;C0019134;C0043031;C0033213;C1532338;C1532338;C0376495;C0376495;C0376495,0,0,-1,14,3.5,0.000757831,0.001230198,0,0
