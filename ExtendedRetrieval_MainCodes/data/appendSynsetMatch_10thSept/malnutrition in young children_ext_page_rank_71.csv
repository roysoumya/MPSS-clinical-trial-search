NCT02441426,Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health and Development,"Malnutrition is considered one of the most prevalent risk factors for morbidity and mortality      in children under five. An estimated 20% of children in the developing world are malnourished      [1] and poor nutrition is linked to more than half of all child deaths worldwide [2].      Malnutrition in early childhood may lead to cognitive and physical deficits and may cause      similar deficits in future generations as malnourished mothers give birth to low birth weight      children [3]. In addition, malnutrition increases susceptibility and incidence of infections      and is associated with diminished response to vaccines.      The MAL-ED Project is designed to determine the impact of enteric infections/diarrhea that      alter gut function and impair children's nutrition, growth and development to help develop      new intervention strategies that can break the vicious enteric infection-malnutrition cycle      and reduce its global burden.      The overall objective of the MAL-ED Project is to quantify the associations of specific      enteric pathogens, measures of physical and mental development, micronutrient malnutrition,      gut function biomarkers, the gut microbiome, and immune responses in very young children in      resource-limited settings across eight sites that vary by culture, economics, geography, and      climate.      The central hypothesis of the MAL-ED Project is that infection (and co-infection) with      specific enteropathogens leads to impaired growth and development and to diminished immune      response to orally administered vaccines by causing intestinal inflammation and/or by      altering intestinal barrier and absorptive function. Data analyses will test for associations      between enteropathogen infections and growth/development to help illuminate:        -  which micro-organisms or mixed infections are most frequently associated with growth           faltering and poor development; and        -  at what age specific infections cause the most disruption to growth and development and           impair immune response.",C0162429;C0008078;C0678723;C0851162;C0699268,C0018271;C0018271;C0018271;C0599735;C0018271;C0024032;C0162429;C0012655;C0162429;C0035648;C0162429;C0524343;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0184661;C0162429;C0162429;C0021368;C0243107;C3714514;C3714514;C0679199;C0005516;C0021853;C0021853;C3714514;C3714514;C3714514;C0220880;C0392209;C0009450;C0018017;C0009450;C0009450;C1704632;C0042210;C0011991;C0031843;C1552740;C0031843;C1552740;C1704632;C0042210;C0031843;C1552740;C1704632;C1706912;C0439662;C0439662;C0018270;C0439662;C0005615;C1442948;C1552861;C0392366;C1552861;C0699819;C1578513;C0699819;C0699819;C0004083;C0004083;C1704632;C0542559;C0011164;C3539125;C3845919;C0311392;C0441229;C0056685;C0031809;C0016538;C2363670;C0016538;C3834249;C0282547;C0016538;C0220644;C4082977,0.0,0.0,1,5.0,1.6666666666666698,0.012375709802482263,0.016541630529276378,1,5
NCT00210418,Effectiveness of Targeting Food Aid to Malnourished Children Compared to Targeting All Children Under Two Years,The objective of this study is to compare two approaches to targeting donated supplementary      food to young children.

NCT02833740,"Comparing Performance of Simplified Mid-Upper Arm Circumference Devices (""Click-MUACs"") to Detect Acute Malnutrition","The Click-Mid-Upper Arm Circumference study aims to describe and compare the performance of a      set of three simplified mid-upper arm circumference classification devices (""Click-MUAC"") for      use by mothers and caregivers to screen for acute malnutrition in young children. The study      will be conducted in Isiolo County, Kenya. The study builds on the recent approach of      training mothers to screen for acute malnutrition in their own children (mother MUAC      approach).      The primary aim of the study is to describe and compare the performance of a set of three      prototype Click-MUAC devices against a gold standard of classification, in terms of measures      of agreement (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, Youden's J) for the      classification (diagnosis) of acute malnutrition. A secondary aim of the study is to      determine the difference in agreement with the gold standard classification amongst      mothers/caregivers using a Click-MUAC prototype versus mothers/caregivers using a regular      MUAC tape. The hypothesis of the study is that at least one of the Click-MUAC prototypes is      equal to the gold standard of classification in terms of measures of agreement for the      classification of acute malnutrition. A secondary hypothesis of the study is that agreement      with the gold standard classification is better amongst mothers/caregivers using a Click-MUAC      prototype compared to mothers/caregivers using a regular MUAC tape. The outcomes of the study      will be used to decide on whether production of a Click-MUAC device is desirable and, if this      is the case, to select a design based on the performance of the prototype devices and the      stated preferences of intended users.",C0562351;C0162429;C1547229;C0025080;C3842106,C0562351;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0446516;C0011900;C0027627;C0027627;C2828392;C2828392;C2828392;C2828392;C1551357;C0199230;C0199230;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0947630;C0018026;C0018026;C0183828;C0018026;C0018026;C0183828;C1273517;C0036849;C0036849;C0442694;C0237677;C0085632;C0035150;C3539125;C3539125;C3539125;C3539125;C3539125;C3539125;C1514811;C0681111;C0681111;C0681111;C0681111;C0681111;C0681111;C0681111;C4255373;C4255373;C4255373;C4255373;C3842106;C3842106;C3842106;C3842106;C3842106;C3842106;C3842106;C4082977,0.0,0.0,1,1.0,1.0,0.013326744617165973,0.012243030941478305,0,3

NCT01115647,Treating Moderate Malnutrition in 6-24 Months Old Children,"Child malnutrition is intimately associated to poverty and may be due to sub-optimal feeding      behaviours, food insecurity at household level, or a combination of both. Acute malnutrition      is a major contributor to under-5 mortality and morbidity in developing countries. While      clinical guidelines for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) have been available for a decade,      research on the management of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) has lagged behind.      Nonetheless, MAM is much more incident than SAM, it increases mortality risk by itself and      requires special nutritional treatment. This study is thus meant to address this major gap,      by testing the relative feasibility, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three innovative      strategies for treating children with MAM aged 6-24 months : a locally produced Ready-to-Use      Therapeutic Food (RUTF), a corn/soy blended flour (CSB++)provided by the World Food Program,      and a specific and context-appropriate child-centred counselling.

NCT00272116,"Effect of Zinc and Vitamin A Supplementation on Diarrhea, Physical Growth and Immune Response in Malnourished Children","Zinc deficiency is common in developing country children, as food intakes are often low,      foods from animal sources are infrequently used, the bioavailability of zinc from staple      cereal-based diets is limited and zinc losses occur during recurring diarrheal illnesses.      Zinc deficiency is associated with impairment in immunological and other defenses against      infection and increased rates of serious infections. Due to limitations in currently used      biochemical markers, supplementation trials in populations likely to be deficient provide a      reliable means of assessing health consequences of zinc deficiency.      A significantly lower incidence and prevalence of diarrhea has been observed in zinc      supplemented developing country children in several placebo-controlled trials. The effect of      routine zinc supplementation on lower respiratory tract infection is still unclear.

NCT01415570,"Malnutrition, Diet and Racial Disparities in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)","In the United States, African Americans are 3.6 time and Hispanics 1.5 times more likely to      suffer from chronic kidney disease and need dialysis treatment for life, when compared to the      non-Hispanic Whites. Unfortunately many dialysis patients die, so that after 5 years only      less than 35% are still alive. Dialysis patients who appear malnourished or who have muscle      and fat wasting are even more likely to die. Interestingly, among dialysis patients,      minorities (African Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans) usually survive longer than the      non-Hispanic Whites. If the investigators can discover the reasons for these so-called      ""racial survival disparities"" of dialysis patients, the investigators may be able to improve      survival for all dialysis patients and maybe even for many other people who suffer from other      chronic diseases. During this 5 year study the investigators would like to test if a      different nutrition and diet can explain better survival of minority dialysis patients. The      investigators will also test if in additional to nutrition there are 2 other reasons for      better survival of minority dialysis patients, namely differences in bone and minerals and      differences in social and psychological and mental health. The investigators plan to study      450 hemodialysis patients every 6 months in several dialysis clinics in Los Angeles South Bay      area. These subjects will include 30% African Americans, 30% Hispanics, 30% non-Hispanic      Whites and 10% Asians. Every 6 months the investigators will examine their nutritional      conditions, dietary intake, psycho-social conditions and quality of life, and will recruit 75      new subjects to replace those who left our study as a result of kidney transplantation, death      or other reasons. Hence, the investigators estimate studying a total of 1,050 hemodialysis      patients over 5 years. Clinical events such as hospital admissions and survival will be      followed. Blood samples will be obtained every 6 months for measurements of hormones and      ""biomarkers"", and the remainder of the blood will be stored in freezers for future      measurements. The investigators plan to design and develop race and ethnicity specific      nutritional risk scores and food questionnaires and will test some of these scores in larger      national databases of hemodialysis patients.

The only relevant source of vitamin B12 is animal-source foods and poor gut~     function may decrease absorption. Vitamin B12 is crucial for normal cell division and~     differentiation, and necessary for the development and myelination of the central nervous~     system. Deficiency is also associated with impaired fetal and infant growth. In the proposed~     study we will measure the effect of daily oral vitamin B12 supplementation to pregnant women~     on neurodevelopment and growth of their children. We also aim to measure the impact of B12~     supplementation on several other outcomes.~      Study design: Individually randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial in pregnant South~     Asian women at risk of poor vitamin B12 status. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1~     ratio.~      Study participants and site: 600 pregnant women from early pregnancy.

Secondary: (i)~     neurodevelopment and cognitive functioning in children at 24 months (ii) gestational age at~     birth, (iii) fetal and infant growth measured by weight and length at birth, after 1 month~     and then at 3, 6, 9, and 24 months, (iv) hemoglobin concentration in children and mothers.~      Relevance for programs and public health: The results from this study can suggest new dietary~     guidelines for South Asian women that again can lead to improved pregnancy outcomes and~     neurodevelopment and cognitive functioning in South Asian children.~   ",C0032961;C0042890;C0242296,C0162791;C0032961;C0032961;C0032961;C0332149;C0184511;C0449416;C0449416;C0018270;C0018270;C0018270;C0018270;C1874451;C0005615;C0005615;C2948600;C2728259;C0042890;C0042890;C0042890;C0042890;C0032042;C0042890;C0042890;C0032042;C0042890;C0011304;C0392335;C0392335;C0032961;C0019029;C1553687;C3714745;C0242296;C0242296;C3845829;C0180112,0.0,0.0,-1,0.0,0.0,0.007271104951011346,0.011482717277899186,0,2
NCT03678233,Efficacy of Testosterone Gel to Restore Normal Serum Values of Testosterone During the Acute Phase of Critical Illness in Adult ICU Patients,"~     Critically ill patients experience major insults that lead to increased protein catabolism.~     Hypermetabolism occurs early and rapidly during the first week of critical illness to provide~     amino acids for the production of energy via gluconeogenesis, and also for the synthesis of~     acute phase proteins and repair of tissue damage. During acute phase, neuroendocrine and~     inflammatory responses promote protein breakdown and amino acid release. Under stress~     conditions, protein synthesis cannot match the increased rate of muscle proteolysis because~     of a state of anabolism resistance, which limits uptake of amino acids into muscles.~     Hypermetabolism results in a significant loss of lean body mass with an impact on weaning~     from the ventilator and muscle recovery. Functional disability may be long term sometimes~     with no full return to normal.~      In critically ill patients, severe and persistent testosterone deficiency is very common and~     is observed early after ICU admission. This acquired hypogonadism promotes the persistent~     loss of skeletal muscle protein and is related to poor outcome.~      Administration of testosterone induces skeletal muscle fiber hypertrophy, decreases protein~     breakdown in healthy young men and burned patients.

NCT00970866,Efficacy of Lipid-Based Nutrient Supplements (LNS) for Pregnant and Lactating Women and Their Infants,"~     In Ghana, low micronutrient intakes among pregnant women are a major problem. The standard~     nutritional intervention during pregnancy is iron-folic acid tablets, but adherence is low.~     The investigators have pioneered the use of multiple micronutrient-fortified semi-solid~     pastes called Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements (LNS) (made using vegetable oil, groundnut,~     milk, sugar, and micronutrients), and the investigators' previous studies show that the~     approach could have great potential for use by pregnant and lactating women.~      This study aims to evaluate the effects of LNS-P&L designed for pregnant and lactating women~     and LNS-20gM designed for infants. Pregnant women (n=864) randomly selected from ante-natal~     clinics in Yilo and Manya Krobo districts of Ghana will be randomized to receive daily (a)~     Group 1: Iron/ Folic Acid tablets during pregnancy, and a tablet containing calcium (Ca) only~     (akin to a placebo) during lactation (6 mo), (b) Group 2: Multiple Micronutrient tablets~     during pregnancy and the first six months of lactation, or (c) Group 3: LNS-P&L during~     pregnancy and lactation, whilst their infants receive LNS-20gM daily from 6 to 18 months.~     There are two primary outcomes namely:~        1. Maternal primary outcome: Birth length~        2. Child primary outcome: Child length-for-age z-score at 18 mo.~      The investigators hypothesize that a) mean birth length and length-for-age at 18 mo will be~     greater in children whose mothers are in Group 2 than those whose mothers are in Group 1, and~     b) children whose mothers are in Group 3 will have greater birth length and length-for-age at~     18 mo than the children in either of the other two groups.~   ",0,C0016410;C0016410;C0032961;C0032961;C0032961;C0032961;C1858460;C0033213;C0441861;C0006675;C0441865;C0441869;C0441865;C0441861;C0441869;C3205672;C0005615;C0005615;C0005615;C0302583;C0032042;C0242209;C4255421,0.0,0.0,-1,196.0,10.8888888888889,0.0014450867052023088,0.006800418721102928,0,2

NCT01821586,Modified ORS Solution for Severely Malnourished Children,"Diarrhoea and malnutrition are the common childhood illnesses responsible for higher deaths      in developing counties. Physiologically, malnourished children excrete lower amounts of salts      and water in diarrhoeal stools, and they also are unable to handle excessive salts and water      load. Some times they are found to be hyponatraemic due to the shift of sodium inside the      cells (inefficient Na+ /K+ pump), and fluids containing higher amounts of sodium (such as the      standard ORS) may lead to further increase in the intracellular sodium, fluid overload and      heart failure. They also have depleted in potassium stores in the body. Recently, the WHO      recommended a special ORS formulation, known as ReSoMal, for management of diarrhoea in      severely malnourished children that contains a lower amount of sodium (45mmol/L) and higher      amount of potassium (40 mmol/L) than the standard WHO-ORS. It is felt that an ORS containing      lower sodium and higher potassium concentration may be useful in correcting hypokalemia, and      in lowering the risks of excess sodium and /or overhydration, in severely malnourished      children with diarrhoea. The safety of ReSoMaL is, however, still in question due to the risk      of hyponatraemia, including symptomatic hyponatraemia, especially in the treatment of severe      watery diarrhoea due to Vibrio cholerae and ETEC where loss of sodium in the stool exceeds      than that is contained in ReSoMal. Thus an ORS solution with modest concentration of sodium      (75 mmol/L) and higher concentration of potassium (40 mmol/L) have been suggested for the      treatment of diarrhoea in these children. To improve the efficacy of oral rehydration, in      terms of reducing the severity of purging and diarrhoea duration, different approaches      (changing the substrates/ reducing the sodium and glucose concentration and osmolarity) have      been tried with limited success. Benefiber (partially hydrolysed guar gum), a soluble fiber      if added to a ORS solution is expected to be fermented in the colon liberating short chain      fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs stimulate sodium and water absorption from the colon, and they      have trophic effect, act as a fuel source for the colonocytes, have antibacterial properties      and stimulates the production commensal flora, thereby may enhance recovery from acute      diarrhoea in severely malnourished children. The aims of our proposed study are to examine      whether an ORS solution with a modest concentration of sodium will prevent the occurrence of      hyponatraemia including symptomatic hyponatraemia, and also whether addition of benefiber      will improve the efficacy of ORS solution. This will be a randomized, double blind,      controlled clinical trial in 186 children with severe malnutrition and watery diarrhoea (62      in each of the three treatment groups) to compare the efficacy of (i) the currently      recommended ORS with some modofication(Na+ 75 mmol/L and K40 momol/L and minerals-Zinc,      copper and magnesium), (ii) ReSoMal (Na+ 45 mmol/L), (iii) Currently recommended ORS (Na+ 75      mmol/L, K 40 momol/L and added minerals) with added Benefiber (25 grams/L), in the treatment      of acute watery diarrhoea in children with severe malnutrition",C0205082;C0162429,C0936233;C0427743;C0311276;C0311276;C0086904;C0546817;C0857122;C0018801;C0086045;C0020488;C0392689;C0020625;C0020625;C0086045;C0086045;C0279516;C0086045;C0020625;C0020625;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C0162429;C1273518;C0020621;C0376636;C0029387;C2347023;C0011991;C0221423;C0032821;C0011991;C0032821;C0032821;C0011991;C0087111;C0011991;C0032821;C0087111;C0011991;C0011991;C1828805;C0011991;C0011991;C0087111;C1828805;C0087111;C0011991;C2828392;C0205082;C2828392;C0205082;C0061996;C0205082;C0221102;C0078516;C0855227;C3245511;C0011065;C0015733;C0566415;C0205082;C1518681;C0449416;C1552839;C0009968;C0043047;C0043047;C0015733;C0225326;C0009368;C0043047;C0009368;C0947630;C0456909;C0182537;C1442948;C0043481;C0231221;C0231221;C0011991;C1820370;C0008354;C0544691;C2004454;C0184511;C0151514;C0000589;C0184511;C0668326;C0668326;C0668326;C0668326;C0035150;C1828805;C0373675;C0332534;C4055646;C0449878;C0449878;C0043047;C0043047;C0043047;C0776963;C0776963;C0776963;C1701972;C4025593;C0231184;C1522634;C0701928;C3834249;C0220644;C3536899,0.0,0.0,1,1.0,1.0,0.021083783964913103,0.01807771744402036,1,1

Glutathione      is made from three amino acids that we get from the protein we eat in our food. We found that      malnourished children were not making enough glutathione because they lacked one of these      amino acids called cysteine. In this study we determine why malnourished children do not have      sufficient cysteine, and we will feed malnourished children a whey-based diet which is rich      in cysteine during their treatment to determine whether they will make more glutathione. This      in turn may make their organs recover faster.

NCT01132742,Malnutrition and Outcome in Hospitalized Children in Europe,"Malnutrition in children has even more severe consequences on disease course and long-term      health than malnutrition in adults. According to prior studies, malnutrition affects about      15-30 % of hospitalized children in Europe (ESPGHAN 2005, Pawellek et al 2008, Joosten and      Hulst 2008). However, available criteria for defining malnutrition in paediatric patients are      inconsistent, not based on firm evidence, and not generally agreed upon. Current guidelines      do not address assessment of and screening for childhood malnutrition. Therefore, a large      number of affected children are not adequately diagnosed.      One aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of malnutrition and patients at risk for      malnutrition among at least 2700 hospitalized children mainly across Europe. In addition      criteria to link anthropometric measurements and the prediction of outcome, i.e. length of      hospital stay, shall be established. A further goal then is to establish agreed,      evidence-based criteria for malnutrition in children with the purpose of leading to an      agreed, evidence-based screening tool for paediatric malnutrition in developed countries.      This tool shall include a set of simple questions, based on previously suggested tools.

NCT01991639,Healthy Life for Frail Malnourished Seniors Performed Together With Trained Lay Buddies,"Background: In elderly subjects frailty and malnutrition are very common and can lead to      serious health hazards, increase mortality, morbidity, dependency, institutionalization and a      reduced quality of life. In Austria, the prevalence of frailty and malnutrition are      increasing steadily and are becoming a challenge for our social system. Physical training and      adequate nutrition can invert it.      Methods/Design: In this randomized, controlled trial 80 malnourished, frail,      community-dwelling patients (≥ 65 years) are recruited. Additionally, 80 lay volunteers (≥ 50      years) named buddies are recruited and subsequently trained regarding health enhancing      physical activity and nutrition in three standardized training sessions. These buddies visit      the malnourished, frail subjects at home twice a week for about one hour during an initial      period of 10-12 weeks. While participants allocated to the intervention group (n=40) conduct      intervention to improve their fluid intake, their protein and energy intake, perform strength      training and try to increase their baseline activities, the control group (n=40) only gets      home visits without any special intervention. After 10-12 weeks, both, the intervention and      the control group, receive the nutrition intervention and the physical training. Health,      nutrition and frailty status, physical fitness and body composition and chronic inflammation      of buddies and frails are recorded before the intervention, after 10-12 weeks, and after 6      and 12 months.      Discussion: To the investigators knowledge this trial is the first of its kind to provide      nutrition and physical activity intervention to malnourished, frail, community-dwelling      subjects by trained lay buddies, in which the health status of buddies is also expected to      improve.

NCT00682708,"Sentinel Surveillance of Malnutrition, Niger","Malnutrition is a critical public health problem in developing countries. Malnutrition may be      linked to more than one half of the deaths in children under 5 years old. In July 2001, after      an intervention related to a measles epidemic, Medecins sans Frontieres-France opened a      nutritional program in Maradi, in the South of Niger. The introduction of ready to use      therapeutic foods (RUTF), in particular Plumpy'Nut (Nutriset, France) allowed for the      treatment of the majority of children at their homes using ambulatory treatment. Children      with complicated cases were cared for in an inpatient center. With ambulatory treatment the      number of children cared for in the MSF program reached close to 70000 in 2006.      This study aimed to assess the effect of a 3-month distribution of RUTF in the context of a      preventative supplementary feeding program. The primary hypotheses were that short-term RUTF      supplementation at the village-level would prevent declines in weight-for-height and reduce      the incidence of wasting in children 6 to 60 mo of age over a period of 8 mo. Because RUTF      may have additional health effects, the intervention effect on height-for-age, stunting,      mortality and morbidity from malaria, diarrhea, and respiratory infection were also examined.",C0733511;C0162429,C0035243;C0242297;C0699943;C0162429;C0162429;C0184661;C0184661;C1561560;C1561560;C0087111;C0087111;C0087111;C0220880;C0011991;C0332128;C0033213;C0025007;C0542559;C0204695;C0235394;C0024530;C0011065;C1518681;C1305866;C0025344;C1518681;C0947630;C0087111;C0376495;C1378698;C2707262;C0233492;C1518681;C0015726;C0015726;C1547298;C0018273;C3842265,0.0,0.0,1,26.0,26.0,0.01843252491358813,0.016690562264627475,0,1

NCT02120599,Interventions for Moderate Malnutrition in Pregnancy,"Malnutrition during pregnancy is more common in poor women in the developing world due to      inadequate dietary intake combined with increased nutrient requirements; pregnancy risk is      more consequential than among other demographic groups with increased risk of maternal and      infant mortality and the lifelong effects of fetal malnutrition. The benefits of treating      moderate malnutrition during pregnancy remain largely undocumented. This study tests the      hypothesis that providing either a fortified flour or fortified paste-based supplementary      food designed to replete the nutrient deficits during pregnancy will result in improved      maternal nutritional recovery rates and higher infant birth weights and lengths.

It is therefore unsurprising that many validated tools for nutrition risk      screening and nutrition assessment exist for the clinician to use in assisting with the      accurate identification, referral and treatment of patients who are malnourished or at risk      of malnutrition.      And nutritional management must be adapted and based on this evaluation and evolution of the      general status (Guidelines Grade A).

NCT02528279,Relapses in Plasmodium Ovale and Efficacy of Artemether-lumefantrine for Mixed Species and Non-falciparum Malaria,"~     Malaria is a protozoan infection transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes. The most severe forms~     are caused by Plasmodium (P) falciparum and to a much lesser extent by P. vivax.~      Although the interest in research on malaria has increased during the last years, yet little~     research is conducted on the neglected malaria species P. ovale and P. malariae. P. ovale~     being first described in 1922, it still remains unclear whether it displays dormant~     pre-erythrocytic liver stages, so called hypnozoites, or not. Primaquine, the only marketed~     drug with liver stage activity at present, can cause severe hemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate~     dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient persons and methemoglobinemia. Because G6PD is widely spread~     in Central Africa, it is important to explore whether additional intake of liver-active~     medication is really needed and on this account further research to investigating new~     treatment options with liver stage activity should be conducted.~      While, due to widespread resistance, treatment recommendations for P. falciparum and mixed~     infections have switched from chloroquine to the safer applicable artemisinin-based~     combination therapies (ACTs), World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines still suggest~     chloroquine as first line treatment for P. malariae and P. ovale mono infections. Further~     studies assessing alternative treatment options are largely missing.~      Summing up the current situation for both topics shows the need for further research.~     Therefore this study aims to assess the evidence and characterize the frequency of relapses~     in P. ovale infections with respect to differences between its subspecies as well as the~     effectiveness of the ACT artemether-lumefantrine in P. malariae and P. ovale mono- and mixed~     infections.~   ",C0531104;C0024530;C0035020,C0025637;C0683525;C0683525;C0531104;C0237834;C0162791;C3714514;C0024530;C0024530;C0024530;C0150312;C0023884;C0023884;C0023884;C0023884;C0052430;C4284232;C3714514;C3714514;C3714514;C0024530;C0024530;C0024530;C0540173;C0035020;C3714514;C0376495;C0376495,0.0,0.0,-1,5.0,5.0,0.005168171131110196,0.0066814377011399145,0,0
NCT01404195,Hyperprotein Nutritional Intervention in Elderly Patients With Hip Fracture and Sarcopenia,"~     1. RATIONALE The unique characteristic of our study lies in the attempt to reverse the~          functional impairment experienced by sarcopenic patients with hip fracture using~          nutritional intervention. What makes this study different from prior studies is that it~          will be conducted in a hospital setting, unlike most prior studies, which were conducted~          in a community setting. The association between muscle mass and strength, inflammatory~          indices, and functional impairment versus dependence and fragility will also be~          measured.~        2. HYPOTHESIS The hypothesis of our study is that nutritional intervention enriched in~          metabolites of essential amino acids (beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate) is effective for~          treating sarcopenia in elderly patients with hip fracture and improves functional level.~        3. OBJECTIVES Primary objective is to assess functional improvement after nutritional~          intervention in sarcopenic patients with hip fracture, as measured using Barthel index.~           Secondary objectives will include: 1) to show the relationship between metabolic and~          inflammatory indices and sarcopenia; 2) to show how sarcopenia and its treatment~          influence the risk of fall; 3) to show muscle mass improvement; 4) to show increased~          strength; 5) to assess mortality and morbidity.~        4. EXPECTED RESULTS The investigators expect to find that the supplemented group~          experiences throughout the study period a significant improvement in functional status~          (Barthel index), an increase in muscle mass, and a reduction in fat mass. An increased~          strength and a reduction in associated complications (falls) are also expected. The~          investigators hope to be able to show reductions in inflammatory indices and insulin~          resistance.~      To conclude, by improving muscle strength and mass the investigators expect to find a~     reduction in the disability and dependence of this population group.~   ",C0016658,C0002520;C0439857;C0439857;C0016658;C0016658;C0016658;C0918012;C0085639;C0598463;C0009566;C0004083;C0596545;C0596545;C0021641;C0237834;C0184511,0.0,0.0,-1,17.0,8.5,0.01445086705202312,0.006464863249052592,0,0
NCT04029532,"Factors Associated With Obesity in Adult Women: Respiratory Exchange Ratio, Heart Rate Variation and Body Image","~     The prevalence of obesity all over the world has increased year by year, and how to~     effectively prevent and treat obesity has become an important health care issue. Many~     adjustable and nonadjustable causes of obesity have been proposed, such as unbalanced eating~     habits, lack of physical activity, psychological factors, and genes. The practice guidelines~     recommended lifestyle modification interventions which include diet control combined with~     regular exercise as the core treatment for obesity, but the effects on different ethnic~     groups are not ideal. In order to provide more choices for future weight loss intervention,~     it would be important to find out more risk factors for obesity. Previous studies have shown~     that lower sympathetic activity assessed by heart rate variability was related to obesity;~     obese men have higher respiratory exchange rates which might indicate they are more likely to~     use carbohydrates as a source of energy, and therefore, fat cannot be effectively consumed~     and led to an accumulation in the body. Furthermore, previous studies showed that Asians are~     less satisfied with their body image than other races, and women are more dissatisfied than~     men. Poor body image will lead to a series of effects, such as changes in eating habits,~     hormonal changes, depression, etc., eventually forming a vicious circle of obesity.
